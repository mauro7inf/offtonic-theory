<p class="text">In the last two sections, we looked at the functional harmonic materials of Common Practice composers.  We looked at the diatonic chords they use, and we looked at the ways in which they incorporate chromaticism, from modulation to secondary chords, to various contrapuntal chords and altered chords.  Now, it's time to throw out the rules and ditch Common Practice altogether.  Modern harmony is often non-functional, but our focus here is on the functional aspects of modern harmony.  This will include harmony in modes other than major and minor (and phrygian dominant), extended chords, unresolved dissonances, writing that <em>isn't</em> for four vocalists, etc.  Sure, <? sectionLinkShort('zero', 'Rule 0'); ?> says we <em>can</em> do anything, but what <em>should</em> we do?  Music theory isn't prescriptive... but I am!  Ha!</p>
<h4 class="question">Are you even qualified to write prescriptions?</h4>
<p class="text">I studied with Dr. Mario.  That's rigorous enough, right?</p>
<h4 class="question">No.  Dr. Mario is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tgwziWf2lM">not a real doctor</a>.</h4>

<h3 class="subsection-title" id="outside">9.6.1 Outside the Four-Voice Model</h3>

<p class="text">We begin by breaking the voice leading rules.  We haven't really studied them in depth, as this will have to wait until a later chapter, but it's not too soon to break them anyway.  The main rules we'll be breaking are the ones against parallel fifths/octaves and the ones promoting smooth voice leading.</p>
<p class="text">The basic model for understanding the Common Practice harmonic language is by visualizing the music as being in four voices, soprano, alto, tenor, and bass, with all four voices being sung by actual, you know, <em>voices</em>.  Some lady (or boy) is singing soprano, some lady (or high-pitched guy) is singing alto, some dude is singing tenor, some guy is singing bass.  None of them are very good singers, so the music has to be easy to sing: no awkward leaps, no augmented intervals, etc.  Other than the bass, none of them have a particularly good range either, so nobody goes very low or very high, and the upper three voices are relatively close together, with the bass much more free.  The four singers have independent parts, so they can't be in parallel fifths or octaves.  They can't sing in tune unless they're singing consonant intervals, so any dissonances need to be prepared and resolved in such a way that lets them hit it.  And, of course, there are exactly four of them, and you can't hire more or have one rest.</p>
<p class="text">Most of these assumptions simply don't hold if you aren't writing vocal music, but there's still merit to them.  These rules allow the music to have a coherent horizontal dimension as well as vertical harmonies.  Yet, these rules are broken <em>all the time</em>.  Well, not <em>all</em> the time, but a lot of the time.</p>
<h4 class="question">So why are they even there?  Are the rules just meant to be broken?</h4>
<p class="text">No, the rules actually serve legitimate musical purposes.  It's just that there are often <em>other</em> legitimate musical purposes that are at odds with these rules, or the specific rules maybe just don't add anything to the music.  Augmented intervals, for example, are often avoided in vocal music because they're hard to sing, but they're not at all hard to play on the piano, so there's no problem there.  We've already seen an example.  In the Mozart sonata movement from the last section, <? exampleLink('K 545 2'); ?>, we can see a nice augmented second in a scalar run in measure 33, and another in measure 40, both between a 7 and a b6.  THe b6 is raised to 6 in minor specifically to prevent this eventuality, so if Mozart were following "the rules", he'd either have used b7 b6 5, which is according to "the rules" for melodic minor, or 7 6 5, since the 7 is harmonically important at that point.  But... he didn't.  Why he didn't, I can't say.</p>
<h4 class="question">Mozart just liked it better that way?</h4>
<p class="text">The thing is, augmented seconds are treated as skips even though they're seconds.  This means that the line is broken up by an augmented second.  If you have several musical lines at the same time close to each other and you start using augmented seconds, it may not be clear which line you're on anymore.  In the case of the Mozart piece, there's just one line at a time, so there's no chance of confusion and no reason to skip the augmented interval.</p>
<p class="text">But we're talking about harmony, not melody.  If we're assuming just one vertical set of notes per chord, for the most part, it's more rare in Common Practice to use augmented seconds...  But <em>we</em> can!</p>

<? createExample('outside functions 1'); ?>

<h4 class="question">That sounds really normal.</h4>
<p class="text">It <em>is</em> normal.  At least to modern ears.  In measures 1-2, the E moving to Db in the soprano is an augmented second, and also the two chords in measure 1 are completely parallel, creating parallel octaves and fifths.  Guess what?  It still sounds good!  The parallel chords (known as <em>planing</em> the chord) are an effect, and since they're not in a context where most movement is contrapuntal, they aren't offensive to the ear.  The resolution into measure 2 follows the rules, though.</p>
<h4 class="question">What do you mean by "most movement is contrapuntal"?</h4>
<p class="text">In most of the past examples, we had four distinct voices, and each one had its own logic, so when multiple voices coincided, either in octaves or in fifths, it stuck out.  Here, instead of thinking of four separate voices, we just have block chords.  A <em>block chord</em> is just a chord where the individual notes in it don't matter too much; all that matters is the overall sound, which is heard as a single block.  Music sounds <em>much</em> smoother when you use traditional voice leading, but who says music should be smooth?</p>
<p class="text">In measures 3-4, we have your standard phrygian half-cadence (iv6 - V), except that it's approached by a V6 instead of a v6 or bVII, which would have a Bb - Ab in the bass instead of B - Ab.  This sounds a bit rough, but that's OK!  Note that the tenor jumps down a tritone in measure 4.  Bach would <em>never</em> do that... except for when he does it <em>all the time</em>, whenever he writes a phrygian half-cadence, which is often.  The tenor jumping down a tritone is the characteristic sound of this half-cadence.</p>
<p class="text">In measures 5-6, we're now in three voices, because why not?  Except at the first chord of measure 6, where it's suddenly four voices.  From the first chord to the second, the bass jumps up an augmented fourth and the alto jumps up an augmented second.  If this passage were sung by three voices, well, they'd get into trouble unless the bass is really good at multiphonics and can sing the low G and the D at the same time (it's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYVnFfLbOv0">actually possible</a>, though it makes your throat a bit scratchy and it's probably not healthy), and also the jump from the Eb to the F# would be hard to get in tune and the bass jump from Ab to D would be even worse.  But I'm playing these chords on the, um, Sibelius playback.  It's trivial for me; I just put the notes on a staff and hit export to audio.  Who cares if it's hard for vocalists?  And even for physical instruments, like the piano, there's no need to worry about singers being skilled.  I'll tell you, when I write for my a cappella group, I have to worry <em>a lot</em> about whether they'll be able to sing stuff.  Every once in a while I'll write something that I think is relatively easy but I miss some important aspect of the voice leading (like preparing dissonances — we'll talk about that in a later chapter) and the group will have such a tough time with it that it will be a bottleneck for the entire piece.  Sometimes I even realize that it's hard, but I figure that maybe they can just practice this one section, and it's problematic for months.  On the piano, though, these chords are not a problem.  Let the singers complain; <em>they</em> don't have to deal with this!</p>
<p class="text">If you're just writing block chords, there's a lot more that you don't need to worry about:</p>

<? createExample('outside functions 2'); ?>

<p class="text">Block chords are heard not as a confluence of horizontal voices but as a sequence of vertical sounds, so the connections between them are far less important.  Here in measures 1-2, for example, we have a simple V - V7 - i, but the voices move wildly and change number.  There are huge jumps, with notes that are way out of singers' ranges, and that's OK.  Nobody has to sing this!</p>
<h4 class="question">So wait, how do I know if a chord is a block chord?</h4>
<p class="text">Hm.  Well, block chords aren't a <em>type</em> of chord; they're just a way of playing chords.  If you're playing them such that all of the notes happen at (roughly) the same time and the inner notes have no horizontal significance, you can call them block chords.  You can choose whether to give those inner notes horizontal significance or not, though, so it's not a property of the chord itself, and different people can even disagree on how you label them.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 3-4 have a little melody accompanied by chords.  This is, as one might expect, extremely common, especially on piano with chords in the left hand and a melody in the right hand (obviously there are many ways to play a song on the piano that aren't this, too).  Since you're not hearing the individual notes of the chords as horizontal voices, they're free to move at will, so you get these parallel chords, changing numbers of voices, etc.  However, there's one thing to watch out for: the melody (or soprano) and the bass <em>are</em> heard as independent voices, so it's generally a good idea to avoid parallel fifths and octaves between melody/soprano and bass.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 5-6 are a little planing progression I discovered.  You hold two notes constant a whole step apart — in this case, the F and the G — and you take a perfect fifth and move it down chromatically.  The result is these <em>added-note chords</em>, which are ordinary chords with additional notes.  We'll talk about the common added-note chords later (we've already seen them in <? sectionLinkShort('chords'); ?> anyway), but I'm denoting them with an "add", which should hopefully clear up inversion numbers.  Note that the second chord would be a 5 4 3 chord, which could be the second inversion of a 9th chord missing a third, but this is a ii chord, not a V chord.</p>
<p class="text">In measures 7-8 we have the opening chords of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mNZAZgXYJo">Super Mario World Ending Theme</a>, which are just regular chords whose voices would normally resolve in specific ways — the C of the ii9 would go down to B, the E down to D#, etc. — but that doesn't happen, and none of the voices in the V+ chord properly resolve to the right note in the I chord.  Interestingly, this progression doesn't sound as good in this block chord format because the soprano is too similar to the bass.  The 5 - 1 in the soprano from 7 to 8 is in parallel octaves with the bass.  In inner voices, this isn't as much of a problem, but between the soprano and bass, it weakens a progression, because you no longer hear the melody and bass as separate entities but rather one line played in octaves.</p>
<h4 class="question">So Koji Kondo fucked up?</h4>
<p class="text">Oh, no no no.  Koji Kondo?  No way!  See, the original doesn't have these as block chords.  The upper voices are all together for the ii9 and V+ chords, but the bass has a different rhythm; at the I chord, the entire instrumentation changes, and the melody note is the 3, not the 1.  Basically, it's <em>my</em> representation of the chords that sucks, not Koji Kondo's original.</p>
<h4 class="question">So <em>you</em> fucked up?</h4>
<p class="text">Kinda?  See, I could have easily fixed this "mistake", but I left it in anyway.  If I were writing a piece to be performed, I would have caught the problem.  I know this because... I'm telling you all this now, right?  But if I <em>had</em> written it correctly, I wouldn't be able to explain to you why it doesn't sound so great.  When I first wrote the chord, it was wrong, and I listened to it and realized that the voice leading was noticeably bad (most of the time with block chords, the voice leading is not noticeable).  Instead of finding a better way of voicing these chords, like I would have done in the previous two sections, I decided to leave it in on purpose.  So I did mess up originally, which is normal, but it's not there due to incompetence.</p>
<p class="text">There's another case in which voice leading doesn't really matter: arpeggiated chords.  Even Bach used parallels in arpeggiated chords.  You can think of the voices in the arpeggio as a compound melody, as different voices of the harmony, or as just a single line; the latter interpretation makes it so that parallels are just not relevant, since you only have one line at a time anyway.  It's good to use smooth voice leading, but it's not offensive to the ear if you don't.  I would give you abstract examples, but since the voicing matters, I'll instead give you a few measures of Nobuo Uematsu's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzl33cnTm1Y">Final Fantasy Prelude</a> (specifically the FFVI version):</p>

<? createExample('FF Prelude'); ?>

<h4 class="question">Noooooo!  Alto clef!  Whyyyyyy?!  But...  But you said!</h4>
<p class="text">Oh, be quiet.  It's not that hard.  Viola parts are in alto clef; deal with it!  The middle line is Middle C.  Count from there.  Yes, it's annoying until you get used to it, and if you're not playing viola or writing for viola you probably won't get used to it very quickly, but it's honestly not that bad.  That said, my plan was to just have one staff for strings, but I realized that one part (probably actually a horn or something; it's all synthesized anyway) stood out of the texture, and the cello was way down in the bass, so fuck it, make it a string ensemble.  At least I kept the violins on one line.  I'm sure this isn't exactly what Nobuo Uematsu wrote, but it's close enough, and besides, I only really care right now about the harp.  (By the way, this piece loops in FFVI, with the first time being just the harp alone and every subsequent time being the full ensemble, so I added measure 17 just to end the example.  It's not in the original.)</p>
<p class="text">If you look at the chords in the harp, even just the first two, you can see that the first chord has the pattern 1 2 3 5 1... going up, and the second chord has the pattern (in chord tones) 1 2 b3 5 1... going up.  From the first chord to the second, then, it's all parallels.  I'm counting the 2 of the chord as a passing tone in all of these chords, by the way, but not the 7.  The third chord is I again, so parallels from vi to I, and the fourth is vi again, so parallels again from I to vi.  The fifth chord is IV6, so that one fixes the parallels, but the sixth chord is V6 — parallels again.  The seventh chord is bVI7, so it's not parallels but you do get an augmented second in the bass voice.  The eighth chord is bVII7, which is parallels again, and it loops back to I, which actually <em>doesn't</em> have parallels because the I chord is 1 2 3 5 but the bVII7 chord is 1 3 5 7.</p>
<p class="text">Once the cello comes in, the bass actually changes: the IV6 and V6 chords actually go to root position, IV and V.  This sounds better with the flute melody, because when the flute A comes in at 9 at the same time as the harp A, the octaves sound less full than the flute A against the cello F.  The voice leading in the strings isn't very contrapuntal, since the strings are heard more as block chords, <em>except</em> for the viola.  The viola has a <em>countermelody</em> against the flute, a melody that happens at the same time as a primary melody and fills in gaps.  Notice that when the flute rests, the viola has quarter notes.  Again, the voice leading has jumps and isn't very smooth.  That's because it doesn't have to be smooth in modern music.  And parallel fifths and octaves are OK.  And you can even resolve the b7 up to 1.</p>
<h4 class="question">Wait, what?</h4>
<p class="text">Or didn't you notice?  The bVI7 was borrowed from minor, but the bVII7 isn't really used in minor and it doesn't go to I because the b7 goes down rather than up.  Here, though, it's not what happens!</p>
<h4 class="question">Let me guess: we'll talk about it later.</h4>
<p class="text">Heh.  Nope!  We're going to talk about it... right now!</p>

<h3 class="subsection-title" id="tonality">9.6.2 Extending the Tonality</h3>

<p class="text">One of the greatest musical advances of the end of the Romantic period was freeing Western art music ("classical" music) from the major/minor dichotomy.  In the standard rich-white-male version of music history, music started out as Gregorian-style plainchant, then music slowly picked up harmony and polyphony, and then music became Baroque (Monteverdi, Bach) with its counterpoint, then Classical (Haydn, Mozart) with its clearer separation of roles within the orchestra, then Romantic (Beethoven, Schubert, Wagner, eventually Mahler) with new chords and textures, then Modern (Schoenberg, Webern, Cage) where all of the rules went away and music became serial and atonal and ugly, with some side period where there were Impressionists (Ravel, Debussy) doing who knows what with scales.</p>
<h4 class="question">But what about, I don't know, John Williams?</h4>
<p class="text">He's derivative; it's not real music; it's not significant music; etc.  Some excuse.  If it doesn't fit this evolution of music, it might as well not exist.  There are some exceptions, like Holst and Vaughan Williams, but modern composers are expected to write ugly music, not tonal music.</p>
<h4 class="question">John Williams wrote some ugly music.  Also, fuck you, atonality can be very pretty.</h4>
<p class="text">Sure.  I agree.  But it does participate in a certain aesthetic that's antithetical to what people who <em>aren't</em> Western art music snobs actually like to listen to.  In contrast to the standard rich-white-male version of music history, there's the Howard Zinn version.  Folk music has basically always existed, not just in Western Europe but also in places like Africa, Arabia, Asia, and even other parts of Europe (along with forms of classical music from all of those places as well), and those musics did not make the same aesthetic choices that Western art music did, with its rigid tonality.  As these musics made contact with the Western art music world, there was cross-pollination in all directions.  In the late 19th century, music started to be a consumer product, first in books as lay musicians started to become music-literate, and eventually in recordings, as well as performances, no longer limited to the elite and its musical tastes.  New forms of music were often less "refined" than the Western art canon, especially in the 20th century, when all "serious" music was atonal (this is a bit of an over-generalization, but only a bit), however, these new forms appealed to a whole lot more people than the old dead white dude composers of yesteryear.</p>
<p class="text">While the standard version of music history has decided that tonal music in the 20th century isn't serious enough, <em>plenty</em> of tonal music has been written in the 20th century, even outside of pop genres.  (I'm not including jazz, which is its own form of "serious" music.)  There's plenty of tonal classical-ish music, especially in the wind orchestra genre, as incidental music for films and even TV, and as theater music, just to name a few.  These genres still range from "serious" art music to lighter popular music; for example, the music played by pops orchestras (like the famous Boston Pops) tends to be the lighter fare, while many orchestras and other ensembles perform more serious (but still tonal) art music like symphonies and such.</p>
<p class="text">While the old dead white dude tonality was replaced by atonality of various types in <em>that</em> stream of history, in the other stream, the people's stream, tonality continued to evolve.  Even in the later parts of the Common Practice Period, new ways of using tonality without discarding it altogether were coming up.  One of those we've already seen: phrygian dominant.  This mode is particularly important in musics in Eastern Europe, Spain, North Africa, and the Middle East, just to name a few, and when composers wanted to use influences from these places, they used phrygian dominant or something like it even though it wasn't major or minor.  The first few bars of Liszt's famous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdH1hSWGFGU">Hungarian Rhapsody Nº2</a>, from way back in <em>1847</em>, are in minor with a major I chord and a b2 scale degree, which is... phrygian dominant!</p>
<p class="text">But the most important advancement for us, in this section, is that music in minor no longer needs a raised leading tone.  We can use modes other than major and minor; we can borrow chords from any of these modes; we can have a <em>functional</em> b7 that resolves to 1.  v - i or v - I or bVII - I can be cadences.  Let's see these in action:</p>

<? createExample('extended functions 1'); ?>

<p class="text">The main beneficiaries of the freedom to have a lowered leading tone are the v and bVII chords.  In measures 1-2 we see a v - i; this progression is in the dorian mode (since it has a b3 and b7 but also a 6).  In measures 3-4 we have a v65 - I, demonstrating the possibilities of both inversion and a 7th chord on the v.  This progression is in mixolydian.  In measures 5-6 we have bVI - bVII - I, sometimes called the <em>aeolian cadence</em> or the <em>Mario cadence</em>.  The latter name comes from Super Mario Bros.'s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lHgmC6PBBE">flagpole fanfare</a>.  The progression is not actually in aeolian, since the key is major and we're borrowing the bVI and bVII, but since the b6 - b7 - 1 melodic motion is characteristic of the aeolian mode (not minor, remember, since minor uses 6 - 7 - 1 going up and b7 - b6 - 5 going down), this progression is known as somehow coming from aeolian.  Note also that the chords are mostly planed, resulting in parallel fifths and octaves.  Could you write this progression without the parallels?  Sure.  But Koji Kondo didn't, and you're not better than Koji Kondo and neither am I, so there.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 7-8 feature bVIIdom7 - i, also known as a <em>backdoor cadence</em>.  The backdoor cadence is pretty much a V7 - vi deceptive cadence in the key of the bIII, but since we're still in the home key, the cadence still reaches the tonic but through the "back door".</p>
<h4 class="question">It's not very satisfying, though.</h4>
<p class="text">It can be in the right context.  Check out Summertime, <? exampleLink('Summertime'); ?>, for a much nicer example (though the voice leading there is very different).</p>
<p class="text">In measures 9-10, we have a bIIIdom42 used as a dominant.  This one isn't really an example of the specific phenomenon we're talking about, since it does have a b2 going to 1, but it's still the kind of thing that wouldn't fly in Common Practice.  Similarly, measures 11-12 are pretty much completely different.  This example is in lydian, and it uses a II chord — not a V/V but a legit II chord — to go to I.  The #4 would normally resolve up to 5, or "sublimate" down to 4, but #4 going to 3 is not a thing that happens in Common Practice unless there's been a modulation, as it strongly recalls the lydian mode, which is outside the Common Practice system.</p>
<h4 class="question">So if I see a #4, it's lydian?</h4>
<p class="text">It's not so black and white.  If you see a #4 going to 5, that #4 is most likely acting as the leading tone to the 5.  If you see a #4 going to 4, it's also acting as the leading tone to the 5; it's just resolving irregularly.  If you see a #4 going to 3, there's a chance that it's lydian, but hey, maybe you've modulated to the iii instead?  It has to do with how stable the #4 is in the scale and whether the natural 4 is also present nearby.  Unless the piece is kind of consistently in lydian, I wouldn't use that explanation, but if the characteristic lydian sound is present, then that's a worthwhile feature to document.</p>
<p class="text">In measures 13-14, there's a simple phrygian dominant progression we've already seen, but the b2 goes up to 3 instead of down to 1, which is both an augmented second and a frustrated leading tone.  The b7 goes up to 1 as well, but the usual rationale for doing that is that the b2 is already going to 1 so b7 - 1 isn't a lowered leading tone resolving up.  This rationale is not present, so we <em>do</em> have a lowered leading tone resolving up.  Screw the rules, man!</p>
<p class="text">Measures 15-16 has two dominant-type chords in a row.  The bVI7 is acting like a tonic, the bVII is acting like a dominant, the v is also acting like a dominant, and the i is the tonic.  What's happening here is that the bVII and v are both in the dominant <em>region</em> of the phrase.  The two chords are very similar, sharing two out of three notes, so we can understand this as the chord simply switching position, kind of like the ii-IV complex.  The b7 also doesn't resolve to the 1 in the v - i progression, but since the b7 has less directionality than the 7, this isn't offensive to the ear.</p>
<p class="text">On the other hand, measures 17-18 <em>are</em> fairly offensive to the ear.  Using the v rather than the V makes the downward motion of the b2 a minor third instead of a diminished third, which at first glance would seem to be smoother, but... it's not.  The v chord feels very out of place.  Its resolution to I makes it at lease resolve convincingly, but the bII6 - v7 itself is weird.  It's a v7 rather than a v because the cross relation between the b2 in the bII6 and the 2 in the v was not pretty, but the resulting progression isn't pretty either.  Maybe you can work out a way to get from bII to v.  If it were bII to vø, that's a different story, but the lack of b2 in the v chord is what makes this one lacking.</p>
<p class="text">Despite what we discussed in the previous section, you'll see that I'm still sticking to the four-voice paradigm.  That's because, despite the situations in modern music when voice leading does not matter, it many cases it still does.  One should generally try to keep the voice leading smooth unless there's a good reason not to, and there are plenty of good reasons not to, as you can see in measures 5-6.  Throughout these other examples, though, there wasn't a good reason not to have happy smooth voice leading.  But now, let's talk about chords where the voice leading often does take a back seat:</p>

<h3 class="subsection-title" id="extended-chords">9.6.3 Extending the Chords</h3>

<p class="text">Back in <? sectionLinkShort('chords'); ?> we looked at a whole bunch of chords with extensions.  <em>Chord extensions</em> are higher-numbered notes in chords.  A triad has a 1, a 3, and a 5; then usually comes the 7; after that are the extensions, or just <em>tensions</em>, the 9, 11, and 13.  I'm going to consider the 7 as part of this system of extensions, even though technically the extensions start at 9, and along with the 7, the added 6th is often used similarly.  As a refresher, here's a recap of <? exampleLink('tertian chords'); ?>:</p>

<? createExample('tertian chords', true); ?>

<p class="text">In Common Practice harmony, 7ths are harmonic dissonances that have to resolve, generally downward (except for M7#5 chords), though you can occasionally get away with something else.  9ths are generally suspensions or some other kind of non-harmonic tone, except in dominant chords (and occasionally a ii9) where the 9th resolves down.  11ths are pretty much always non-harmonic.  13ths are only harmonic in dominant chords, where they might be an anticipation of the third of the chord of resolution or a non-harmonic appoggiatura, like in a cadential 64.  Added 6ths simply don't happen, and when they do, they're actually the root of a first-inversion chord, not an added 6th at all.</p>
<p class="text">The situation is different in extended tonality.  While these extensions are still dissonant, there is no longer any need for them to resolve, and instead, they're used as color tones.</p>
<h4 class="question">Color tones?  Are they blue or green?</h4>
<p class="text">Well.  If you have synæsthesia, maybe?  What I mean, though, is that these added notes make the chord sound different without changing its function.  A I chord with an added 9th is still a I chord; it just also has an added 9th.</p>
<h4 class="question">But in <? exampleLink('outside functions 2'); ?> you have an add2 chord.  What's the difference between that and an added 9th?</h4>
<p class="text">Literally none.  However, there are a couple of conventions.  First, a chord that's actually a 9th chord or an 11th chord or a 13th chord <em>also contains a 7th</em>.  An added-6th chord does not, and neither does a 6/9 chord.  So, if the 7th is present, I'll use the higher numbers for harmonic dissonances but <em>not</em> for non-harmonic tones.  A 7th chord with a suspended 4th is not an 11th chord.  (Exception: the 9-8 suspension.)  On the other hand, when the 7th is not present, I may go either way, but I tend to prefer the lower numbers.  The higher numbers aren't <em>wrong</em>.  There are likely to be corner cases as well.  The important thing to remember is that this is not important.  Who cares what I call it?  Call it whatever you want!</p>
<p class="text">Let's see how these chords work:</p>

<? createExample('extension functions 1'); ?>

<p class="text">First of all, this is not by any means an exhaustive list.  There's a <em>whole</em> lot more you could do with chord extensions.  Check out <? sectionLinkShort('chords'); ?> for more examples and more voicings.  We don't need to rehash that whole chapter here.</p>
<p class="text">In measures 1-2 we have ii11 - V9b13 - I13, with "good" voice leading.  The first thing we notice is that all three chords are in root position.  That's not a requirement, but once we start adding a bunch of extensions, the identity of the chord becomes murkier without the bass solidly telling us which is the root, so you'll generally find that complex chords are in root position.  7th chords are more frequently inverted, but chords with more extensions suffer when inverted.  Doesn't mean <em>you</em> can't invert them, obviously.  Anyway, this measure just has a simple ii - V - I, but with... stuff.  This kind of thing is incredibly common in jazz.  Let's look at this stuff.  In the ii11 chord we have a 9 and an 11.  The 9 tends to resolve down, but the 11 is actually the root of the next chord, so it often has a kind of pedal feel and wants to stay where it is.  In the next chord, the V9b13, the 11th of the previous chord stays, and the 9th goes down, but to the b13th of this chord rather than the 5th (which is omitted, as normal).  There's no 11th, but there is a 9th, which wants to resolve down, but it doesn't have to: in the resolution, the I13, the 9th of the previous chord stays.  The 13th (or 6th) in tonic-type chords does have a tendency to resolve down as a non-harmonic dissonance — meaning that it wants to go down to the 5 in a 6-5 suspension — but part of the appeal of extended chords is that you don't need to resolve suspensions.  The other interesting notes of the I13 chord are the 9th, which just adds color (it could resolve non-harmonically either up or down, but it doesn't), and the 7th, making the chord more melancholy.  The 11th is omitted, as is usual for tonic-type chords.</p>
<p class="text">In measures 3-4, we go the other way: measures 1-2 use six-note voicings, but measures 3-4 use only three-note voicings.  It's still a I - ii - V - I, but more creatively.  First, the first chord is a I+6 (written I6#, where, remember, the # by itself refers to #3).  This is an altered I chord; you could call it V+/IV if you wanted, but I don't think that's necessary.  It's in first inversion, but it's also just a triad, so that's not a big deal.  The second chord is a simple ii6, nothing special here.  The third chord is a minimalist V13: it's got the 1 in the bass, then the 3 in the alto and the 13 in the soprano, skipping the 5 and 7 (and 9 and 11).  Turns out that this chord is equivalent to iii6, which we've been using elsewhere in the book for this same chord, so we call it a iii6, but it's really more of a V chord than a iii chord.  And finally, the I6/9, with the third and fifth both omitted.</p>
<h4 class="question">You can skip the third in a I chord?  Then how do you know it's I and not i?</h4>
<p class="text">Sure you can, why not?  In this case, since the third is heard in the previous chord, there's no question that the missing third is that note, which is the major third of the chord.  In addition, the parallelism of the alto and soprano is maintained.  We also have two important resolutions: the 13th of the V chord resolving to the 9th of the I chord — that's its usual role in the V chord, though it can also skip down to I — and the leading tone resolving down to the sixth of the scale instead of up to the tonic.  By accepting the 6 as a chord tone of the I chord, we free up the leading tone to resolve down instead of up without being disappointing, like when the 7 goes down to 5.</p>
<p class="text">In measures 5-6, we have some more complex chords, this time with b5's and #11's.  The first chord demonstrates extensions on a secondary dominant; the b5 adds a crunch to dominant 7th chords, and as a chromatically altered note, it tends to resolve down.  The second chord is a bit more interesting.  First, every note other than the 7th moved down a half step from the previous chord, so while the previous chord was a V9b5/V, this is a bII9#11, the difference being that V9 is a dominant 9th while bII9 is a major 9th.  Do you remember the FrV chord?  This is basically that, but since it has a 7 rather than a #6, I called it a bII rather than a FrV: it's a 7th chord, not an aug6.  It still generally works the same way, though.  We call this bII standing in for a V a <em>tritone substitution</em>, since the bII chord is a tritone away from the V.  It's <em>usually</em> a dominant 7th of some type (well, an augmented 6th, really), but It's often a major 7th too, because why not?  The only trouble is that this means that almost all of the notes in the chord have a tendency to resolve down... and they do.  The I chord that follows is one half step down in every voice, making this an example of planing.  The only kind of surprising one is that the G in the second chord goes down to the F#.  Admittedly, it's because I wanted a #11 in the I chord, not because it's a tendency of the note.  The #11 is a very melancholy note, bringing out the major 7th of the chord; when the major 7th is not there, though, it's a very happy note (as we'll see in measure 25).</p>
<p class="text">Measures 7-8 are pretty simple, but the number of voices isn't constant, which is OK.  The first chord is a IV7 we've seen plenty of times before, and the 7th resolves normally, but its use here is relevant because the other two chords also contain 7ths, and it's often a good thing to keep the weight of the extensions fairly consistent.  The V+7 chord basically just splits the E from the IV7 for a little extra crunch.  The I7 chord demonstrates what is basically the default in any kind of jazzy music, where all chords are 7th chords, and the 7th has no particular need to resolve.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 9-10 are an updated version of <? exampleLink('special functions 2'); ?> measures 31-32, where we had ii7 - cto7 - I6 but now have an added note in the I6 chord.  This note is the 6th of the chord, but it's the 4th above the bass, so it's add4 rather than add6.  (As a pop chord, it would just be C6/E.)  Again, you have that 6th of the scale staying constant for all three chords.  This is a progression reminiscent of ragtime/Dixieland cadences and other music that borrows from those styles.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 11-12 are another example of an added 6th chord as a tonic.  The first chord, the ii65, could also be interpreted as IVadd6, but we don't need to do that since the ii65 already has that function.  The second chord, a V9#5, might more properly be a V+add2, but since it's a dominant chord, I prefer the 9th terminology even though the 7th is missing.  Again, the 6 of the scale stays constant throughout the three chords of this cadence.  The 7 in the V chord goes down to the 5 instead of up to the 1, but just as in the case of the V7 - I motion where the same thing happens, the frustrated resolution of the leading tone is hidden by the powerful resolution of the #2 up to the 3.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 13-15 explore the added 2 or 9.  In a major chord, the added 2 is very happy, but in a minor chord, it's very sad.  NOT THAT MAJOR IS HAPPY AND MINOR IS SAD.  That's not true!  But when the 2 is added, the mood does brighten in a major chord and darken in a minor one.  In all four chords in 13 and 14, the second (or ninth) and third are next to each other.  This is obviously not necessary, but it adds a bit of dissonance, especially in the minor case where the interval is a minor second.  When resolving a second, usually the more dissonant note usually resolves by step; this happens in most of these chords.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 16-18 are a minor version of the previous phrase, still exemplifying the added 9ths.  This time, there's a Neapolitan chord, because the iiø chord really doesn't like an added 9th.  The diatonic 9th is a b9, which clashes against the b3 of the chord, and the major 9th weakens the mode by using a 3 rather than a b3.  Another feature is the addition of a <em>major</em> 7th to the i chord.  This is quite dissonant, but composers like dissonance; it doesn't need to resolve.  Most of the time, the note you add to a i chord is the b7, making it a i7 (measures 29, 31), but the mM7 option is also a good one, depending on context.  In jazz, such a chord would be said to come from the melodic minor scale, but we don't need to think of chords as coming from scales right now (it's better to think of scales as coming from chords, honestly).</p>
<p class="text">Measures 19-20 have some fun chromatic stuff.  And parallel fifths.  Yay parallel fifths!  The first chord is your normal I7, but we have a scalar line in the soprano and one in the bass, and we want to keep them both going.  THe second chord, then, just has the three upper voices move up while the bass moves down, resulting in parallel fifths, but the scalar motion hides the inner dissonances.  The 7th generally wants to resolve down, but that's not happening in either chord in measure 19.  The second chord is actually missing its third.  The third is <em>not necessary</em> in a major 7th chord.  I mean, really, it's not necessary in general, since you can write whatever you want, but there are some chords where the third is relatively inessential, and they include the major and minor 9th chords and the ø7, but less so with dominant chords.  The idea is that the mode is clear enough from the other notes, and the third isn't contributing anything in particular to the sound.  In the dominant 7th, the third forms a definitional tritone with the b7, and it's a big part of the chord moving forward.</p>
<p class="text">The fun chord, though, is the downbeat of 20.  Look at that monstrosity.  Only four notes, and it's...  What is it?  Who knows!  The notes are b6 and #4, making it some kind of aug6 chord... but then there's a 7 and a #1.  The 7 could be heard as an anticipation of the 7 in the V7 chord that follows, or it could not; the #1 is halfway between the Italian and French chords, so... Turinese?  All of the notes are functional; there aren't even any parallel fifths since the #4 goes to 4 instead of 5.  I called it an It6#3add2 (remember, the # on its own means #3), because the 2 is the <em>diatonic</em> 2 above the bass, but you could also just call it a bVI11b7 (in pop chord notation, this would be an Ab11 chord, a dominant 11th).  We already saw an aug6 chord with a minor third in <? exampleLink('Chopin Prelude 4'); ?>.  Another possibility might be to call it an It62#3 or something like that, but it's stretching the It a bit too thin, I think.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 21-22 show some fun 11th chords.  A tonic 11th chord is usually ugly, but they can work as pre-dominants and certainly as dominants.  Here, though, the vi11 is behaving more like a G/A slash chord, with a second-inversion G major triad in the right hand and an A in the bass.  This is the preferred way to voice slash chords because it sounds nice and resonant, but of course it's not the only way.  The V11, on the other hand, is a common chord in modern music and it's kind of a mix between a IV chord and a V chord at the same time, both resolving to I.  The 11th is a common tone with the resolution, but in this case, it resolved to the 7th (because that's a thing now).  The other notes of the chord resolve as normal.  Notice that these 11th chords have a 7th and 9th but no 3rd.  The 11th clashes with the 3rd in dominant 11th chords.  In m11 chords, the 11 doesn't really clash with anything but it also doesn't have any built-in directionality (it stays as a common tone in ii11 chords, generally); in M11 chords, the 11 clashes hard with the 3rd and the 7th, so you don't often see M11 chords.  Instead, you see M7#11, also known as lydian chords, as we saw in measures 5 and 6.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 23-24 have a fairly non-convincing use of dominant 7ths as tonic chords.  This would make more sense in a blues format (see <? exampleLink('Sharp Nine Blues'); ?>), so check back to the blues examples from earlier.  This basically just shows that any type of 7th can be added to a tonic chord and not resolved.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 25-26 feature an added #4.  The #4 is just about the prettiest note you can add to a chord, more so than the 2.  The second chord is a favorite; it's a chord with a 9th in the melody.  The 9th is <em>not</em> just there for color (the 6th is, making this a 6/9 chord).  Rather, the 9th is essential to the sound of this chord, and it demonstrates the possibility of harmonizing a note with a chord whose root is a second below it.  The next chord, the bII6/9, is a tritone substitution; again, instead of a V chord, you use a bII chord.  Classically, this tritone substitution is actually a FrV chord, but in modern music that does not have to be the case, so we just have a bunch of notes that can resolve chromatically.  The 6th is in the melody, which could also suggest a first-inversion bvii11.  Finally, the I13 chord just has a bunch of chromatic resolutions from the previous chord, going in both directions.  The 7, 9, and 13 are both consonant notes in extended tonality.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 27-28 are inspired by modern musical theater: sus2 chords and sus4 chords implying different roots.  I called it a 52 chord, and I think that's relatively unambiguous.</p>
<h4 class="question">Relatively unambiguous.  That's relatively an oxymoron.</h4>
<p class="text">Oh, shut it.  The same perfect fifth, the 1 and 5 of the scale, can have a 2 in between them for a I chord with suspended 2 or a 4 between them for a IV chord with suspended 2, and composers like Stephen Sondheim and Jason Robert Brown use this possibility of a shift in interpretation to make chords that aren't too in-your-face but still imply definite roots.  A major aspect of the sound of extended tonality, in many cases, is that people <em>don't</em> want to sound like Common Practice music, <em>on purpose</em>.  Common Practice music is heavily based on triads, so if a composer can get away with using chords that aren't triads, that's a big deal.  However, triads are still the best option for harmony.  What to do?  The clearest possibility is to simply add extensions to the triads; now they're no longer triads but they still work just fine.  These two measures take a different approach, using ambiguous non-triadic chords to <em>imply</em> triads without actually stating them outright.  The bass tells you what the triad <em>ought</em> to be, but you don't get the sound of the triad.</p>
<p class="text">Also, in the Western system, thirds are notoriously out of tune, so using only fourths and fifths (and seconds) sidesteps that problem entirely, creating a crisp sound, just like how power chords omit the third to prevent additional muddiness in an already muddy sound.</p>
<p class="text">Finally, measures 29-31 have some more minor 7th chords, just because I kind of neglected the minor mode in the other examples.  There's even a triad, the V, which sounds a little out of place with all of the 7th chords around it.  The 7ths don't necessarily resolve down, making these more like block chords.  The final chord, a minor 9th, has no third, demonstrating that the third is really unnecessary in such chords.</p>
<p class="text">There's a <em>lot</em> more you can do with extended chords within functional harmony — that is, where there's a clear tonic and the chords all relate, directly or indirectly, to that tonic, and movement from one chord to the next follows these relations.  As I mentioned, an inventory of possible added tones is in <? sectionLinkSHort('chords'); ?>, but the best way to learn is by seeing them used in real music.  We'll do lots of that.  Here's one example, adapted from my a cappella arrangement of Tom Jobim's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1tOV7y94DY">Águas de Março</a>:</p>

<? createExample('Águas de Março chords'); ?>

<p class="text">This isn't the whole piece, and it's not even the original song; I wrote an a cappella arrangement for my group, and I glued together a few representative sections of it to make this excerpt.  The flute represents the soloist (my arrangement actually has three, but never mind that), the bottom guitar staff is the bass, and the upper staff is soprano, alto, and tenor (remember that guitar reads up an octave, so all of these notes sound an octave lower than written).  Measures 10, 13, 14, and 17 have a baritone part as well (the bass splits).</p>
<h4 class="question">What are those little triangles over some of the bass notes?</h4>
<p class="text">It's called various things, like a staccato (though that's usually the dot) or a staccatissimo, but the note is to be played very short.  The idea here is that the bass should sound like a kind of percussive sound you can make when you stop the strings of the guitar with your right hand.  The syllable for the quarter notes is "doom" while the syllable for the staccatissimo eighth notes is a hard "D".  Of course, you don't see any of that here because I didn't actually show you the a cappella score — there's too much stuff there.  This is more readable, I feel.</p>
<p class="text">Before we get to the chords, let's look at measures 18-21.  You see those colored notes?  What's happening is that the three voices are moving down chromatically while the bass stays on D.  The green voice goes C B Bb A, the blue voice goes A G# G F#, and the yellow voice goes F E Eb D.  I didn't show it in this example but you can find it in the recording I linked above with Tom Jobim and Elis Regina (which is in Bb, not in D, but same thing): these three chromatic lines go in order!  C B Bb A, A G# G F#, F E Eb D, C B Bb A, A G# G F#, F E Eb D, C B Bb A, etc.  If you play these notes, someone else comes in four bars later and plays the same notes from the beginning, and someone <em>else</em> comes in four bars later and plays the same notes from the beginning, you'll get an endless pattern of the chords from 18-21, almost like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepard_tone">Shepard tones</a>.  These chromatic lines, especially the green and blue voices, are actually mostly constant throughout the piece.  This arrangement doesn't really preserve them, so you see that it jumps around; for example, from 2 to 5, the green line stays in the bass, but the blue line starts on the tenor and ends up on the soprano.  There are various countermelodies not shown here that highlight these lines or parts thereof as well.  The constantly descending lines, as well as the repetitive falling melody, give this piece an exhausted feel and remind the listener of falling rain.  The D in the melody is a pedal, so it's present in every chord, and it's another element of monotony and repetition that the waters of March promise to end.</p>
<p class="text">So, the chords.  Tom Jobim is a master of harmony, and as a jazz composer — or, rather, as a bossa nova composer whose music shares important harmonic and stylistic features with jazz — he uses lots of extended chords.  Almost every chord except the final chord (and measure 11, depending on how you read the melody) is extended (in the original, the final chord appears more often, so it's not necessarily meaningful that it's the final chord specifically).  I didn't copy the chords <em>exactly</em>, but I feel it's close enough.</p>
<p class="text">The first phrase is measures 2-5 (measure 1 is part of the intro, which is just that one chord).  The song is a bit surprising, because it begins on a 42 chord.  You hear the bass, but the chord that sounds doesn't have the bass as root.  Since it's a dominant 7th, for all you know, it's a V42, but when the melody comes in, it's clear that the D is the tonic (Bb in the original), and the chord is actually a V42/IV.  Except that it doesn't go to IV.  It <em>wants</em> to go to IV, and the bass resolves as if the V42/IV is going to IV6 like you'd expect, but the tenor goes to the #4 instead of the 4, giving us a viiø65/V.</p>
<h4 class="question">Is that functional, though?  How can you call the first chord a V/IV when it doesn't go to IV, and how can you call this one a viiø/V when it doesn't go to V?</h4>
<p class="text">IV and viiø/V are both pre-dominant chords, so they fulfill similar roles.  The viiø/V here is actually a substitute for the IV.  The V/IV still has directionality towards the IV; it just doesn't quite reach it.</p>
<p class="text">The next chord, at measure 4, would be written in any lead sheet as Gm6/Bb (and the chord at measure 3 would be written Bm6), but since the iiø and iv are basically the same chord anyway, I didn't feel that was a useful distinction to make.  If you remember back in <? exampleLink('borrowed functions 1'); ?> measure 9, we had IV - iv - I.  The iv isn't a dominant chord; it's still pre-dominant.  When you have pre-dominant resolving to tonic, this is generally called a <em>plagal cadence</em>, but IV - iv - I has a bit more resolution than an ordinary plagal cadence.  This iiø43 is, at heart, just an extended iv6, fulfilling the same role as the iv in the IV - iv - I.  The I, at measure 5, is actually a major 7th chord in second inversion (the root is in the melody, not the soprano/alto/tenor), so the 6 - b6 - 5 of the IV - iv - I is actually in the bass.  Actually, it's b7 - 6 - b6 - 5, the green chromatic line, making what's essentially V42/IV - IV6 - iv6 - I64, except with substitutions and extensions.  In the end, these weird chromatic-sounding chords are nothing more than twists on the same triads we know and love!</p>
<p class="text">About half of the time in this song, we would now move on to a different phrase, like the one beginning at 10 or the one beginning at 18, but the other half of the time, this phrase we just analyzed <em>continues</em>.  In modern music there's more tolerance for second-inversion chords as being somewhat final and not needing resolution; they're felt as weak, but not necessarily unstable, since the fourth is no more dissonant than... well, every other interval that doesn't need resolution in modern music, which is pretty much all of them.  Still, the real finality is the root position I chord, so we're not done yet — we have to get to that I!</p>
<p class="text">And... we start with something great: an augmented 6th chord with an added 9th at measure 6.  Can't say no to that!  This chord took me a while to analyze, probably because I had it spelled with a G# in the bass an an A# in the soprano.  I knew it was some sort of dominant 7th, since G# C F# is enharmonic to a dominant 7th; with the A# and the D (in the melody), my feeling was that this was a G#9b5.  But then... what other chord is a dominant with a b5?  The FrV, which is nothing more than a V7b5 chord!  Except that the FrV is actually <em>two</em> 7b5 chords, the V7b5 and the bIIdom7b5, depending on how you spell it.  I was stumped on this chord until I realized that I could spell the G# as Ab, and Ab C D F# is a French aug6 chord.  What kind of French aug6 resolves to IV instead of V?  Why, a FrV/IV!  Problem solved!  The A# is actually a Bb, a chord extension on this already crunchy chord for MAXIMUM CRUNCH!  I labeled it FrV943 instead of FrV432, because the added note felt more like an actual 9th than a random 2 above the bass, but really, any chord symbol that doesn't have the standard numbers on it — nothing, 6, 64, 7, 65, 43, 42 — is going to be somewhat arbitrary anyway.  It goes to show that the Roman numerals themselves are just a label; understanding how they're applied is the analysis.</p>
<p class="text">The crunchy FrV943/IV (I love how that looks) resolves to IV9, which is just an extended IV chord.  That IV at measure 7 then goes to V at measure 8 and I at measure 9...  HA, no it doesn't!  It goes to a bVIIdom13.  That's an extended chord!  Notice the quartal voicing of the upper three voices: Bb E A D.  In jazz and jazzy music, voicing chords by fourths is a way to get some very pleasant-sounding crunch, but you generally want to avoid the root in that stack of fourths unless you want the fourth of the chord, which most of the time you don't want.  That said, the 9th and 13th (or 6th, if you think of this as a 6/9 chord that also has a 7th) are really anticipations of the resolution to the I, so maybe they're non-harmonic?  In any case, the bVIIdom13 resolves to I, making this another backdoor cadence.  There are two cadential forces at play: the b7 in the bass resolving up to 1, a staple of the modern minor mode (which we're not in, but we can always borrow), and the b6 going down to 5 in the tenor.  These two elements are what make a backdoor cadence, and it turns out that adding the 9th or 13th to the bVIIdom7 chord to anticipate the I help make the cadence more convincing.  The 11th is also an option, but in major, the 11th is not in the resolution, so it works less well.  By the way, the I6/9 at 9 is really a 6/9 just because I didn't want the soprano and alto to resolve to boring chord tones.  It ended up being a voicing by fifths, which is usually somewhat harsh.  I don't think it's too bad, but maybe you do.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 10-13 are another phrase, and this time there's a little countermelody in the soprano.  The bass splits so that the blue chromatic line doesn't disappear.  With that countermelody, the first chord at 10 is a V11/IV, nice and crunchy without the third.  But the third is actually important to the chord, and we see that the G at measure 10 is non-harmonic: it resolves down to the F#, the actual chord tone.  The sonority at the downbeat is very much that of an 11th chord, though, so we don't hear the 11th as non-harmonic until it's resolved.  The 9th also becomes the b9, but that's because the alto is harmonizing with the soprano countermelody.  The V7b9/IV is a more ordinary extended chord, but it's usually present in minor, while here the IV is supposed to be major.  It isn't, but it's supposed to be.  That counts, right?</p>
<p class="text">In measure 11, the texture changes, mostly because I saw some video of this song where the texture changed there and I liked it.  The chord here has the bass doing the blue line, so the G# is important, and Tom Jobim opts for sudden consonance here, with a first-inversion triad, the V6/V.  Again, V/IV resolving to V/V means that the V/V is substituting for the IV.</p>
<h4 class="question">What about the D and F# in the melody?  Don't they make it a V65/V or a 9th chord of some sort?</h4>
<p class="text">I don't really hear that.  I hear the melody more as an anticipation of the next bar than as part of the harmony of this one.  That said, you're welcome to analyze it differently.  To me, the melody is not interacting with this V6/V chord, but maybe to you it is.</p>
<p class="text">The V6/V goes to iiø65, the iv substitute, similar to measure 4.  That shouldn't be too much of a surprise, since both phrases are filling out the notes of a combination of the green and blue chromatic lines, and the #4 with 6 moving to 4 with b6 is a feature of these two lines being played together.  That iiø65 then (predictably, since it's a V/IV - IV - iv6 - I loop with substitutions) goes to I6/9, the extended chord, also voiced here in fourths.  Try to contrast the sound of the chord at 13 in fourths with the similar chord at 14 in thirds, both on the same root, though they have some different extensions.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 14-17 repeat measures 10-13, except the second measure of the phrase, which is different.  Here, Tom Jobim must have wanted less consonance, because instead of a simple V6/V, it's a viiø65/V.  Same function, less consonant chord.</p>
<p class="text">Finally, 18-21 are an interesting chromatic version of the I - ii42 - V65 - I, where everything is substituted except the last chord.  The first I becomes a i7 at 18: a bit of modal interchange, I suppose (which actually affects the melody, now on F naturals instead of F#'s).  The ii42 becomes a V42/V, a very common secondary dominant with the same root.  The V65 becomes its tritone substitution, bII, but as a major 7th instead of a dominant 7th, so bII42.  And that goes to I.  This would be unremarkable except for the fact that the bass stays on the same note the entire time and the other three voices do nothing other than descend chromatically.  (In fact, it might be better to call the bass a tonic pedal and interpret the chord at 20 as simply bII.)</p>
<h4 class="question">So?  Why is this important?</h4>
<p class="text">It's important because it's a useful bit of trickery.  Without leaving the realm of <em>functional</em> harmony, we were able to analyze a bunch of triads descending in parallel.  It's essentially magic.  F major - E major - Eb major - D major magically becomes an altered I - ii - V - I, because the F major is really D minor, the E major is really E dominant, and the Eb major is really A dominant.  Other than the I at the end, nothing is as it seems!  These chromatic chords are generally non-functional, but we were able to give them real function.  It's amazing that this is even possible.</p>
<p class="text">As a final note — ha — look at the downbeat of 21.  I wanted to end there, but I like the coda (21-22) too much to leave it out.  Do you see what's happening on that downbeat?</p>
<h4 class="question">No...</h4>
<p class="text">This is the first time any of the upper voices has anything on a downbeat.  Measures 1 and 2 have rests, and from measure 3 onwards, every measure actually begins an eighth note early in the upper voices.  But at 21, the syncopation is gone.  This wait that everyone has to do is what makes this moment powerful.  Syncopation is ordinary, but go <em>on</em> the downbeat, <em>pow</em>!  Much stronger!  When everything is on the downbeat, you don't notice it, but when everything is early, the one time when it's on time stands out.</p>
<p class="text">Another piece with interesting usage of extended chords is David Wise's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDvKwSVuUGA">Aquatic Ambiance</a>, from the original Donkey Kong Country for SNES.  I'm just going to quote a sample, but you should listen to the whole thing and try to imagine what it would be like to go into your first water level full of rendered sprites, with these two beautifully-rendered simians exploring the calm waters of Kongo Jungle.</p>
<h4 class="question">That's nice.  It's so nostalgic to think of the world before Croctopus Chase and Poison Pond.</h4>
<p class="text">Ugh.  Croctopus Chase was the bane of my existence as a kid.  At least it's not like in DKC2 where David Wise's beautiful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J67nkzoJ_2M">underwater theme</a>, instead of being used underwater, was the score for Bramble Scramble.  And <em>Animal Antics</em>.</p>
<h4 class="question">THE PAIN!  GAAAH!  Just get to the example already!</h4>

<? createExample('Aquatic Ambiance chords'); ?>

<h4 class="question">That doesn't sound very good.  Why didn't you make it nicer?</h4>
<p class="text">Two reasons.  First, we all know you can't compete with David Wise, so why even try?  Second, Aquatic Ambiance's effectiveness is largely based on the feel of its synth effects.  There are echoes and delays that weave in and out, timing variations, a constantly rising pitch kind of like when you fill a bottle from the sink, and just a whole lot of playing with color.  These variations are slow, which give an effect like being underwater; it's not quite muffled, but it's, well, serene, and that effect comes from the synths that I just can't easily reproduce in Sibelius.</p>
<p class="text">Also, the transcription was pretty hard to do, thanks to confusing strings, but it's possible to find the original SPC files and turn them into MIDI, then open them in Sibelius.  The sheet music comes out <em>horribly</em> mangled, but at least I could get the string chords.  The upside is that the notes are right, and the style is absolutely not right and you should listen to the original for the style.</p>
<p class="text">The chords here are almost what we might call <em>pan-diatonic</em>, meaning that they span the entire diatonic scale, in this case C (natural) minor.  There are four chords that mostly repeat throughout the piece, which without extensions are just i - bVI - iv - bVII6, or, more precisely, i - bVI - i - bVI - iv - bVII6.  The sections are twelve bars long, with each chord taking two bars; the intro is just a bit special because of the extra measure (measure 5) where the music just kind of stops.  We haven't talked much about pop progressions yet, but just to give you a preview, a big chunk of pop songs use a repeating four-chord loop, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOlDewpCfZQ">I - V - vi - IV</a>, or they might shift this by two chords and go vi - IV - I - V.  This latter chord loop is actually ambiguous — maybe what you thought was a vi is really a i, so the progression is i - bVI - bIII - bVII.  Let's say we're in C major.  vi - IV - I - V is Am - F - C - G.  But if we're actually in A minor, those four chords are i - bVI - bIII - bVII.  In any case, the only difference between this and Aquatic Ambiance, in broad strokes, is that the third chord is iv instead of bIII.  In Aquatic Ambiance, there's another cool thing, which is that the bass notes keep going down by thirds most of the time: i - bVI is down a third, bVI - iv is down a third, iv - bVII6 is... up a sixth, but that's the same as down a third.  It's just bVII6 - i which is down a second instead of a third.</p>
<p class="text">With that context, let's take a look at the extensions on these chords.  The chords are complex, but unlike the Águas de Março example, they're <em>strictly</em> diatonic.  The first chord is our i9, which shouldn't be unfamiliar.  A lot of music uses tonic 9th chords, usually major or minor.  The minor 9th in particular has a kind of painful feel because of the minor second between the 9 and the b3, which you can hear in the first two notes of the... melody?  Sure, it's a melody, let's go with that.  The b7 is also in the melody.  The held notes are the 1, b3, 5, and 9, but the melody accentuates the b7 as well, so that note is still heard as part of the chord.  Usually, if the note doesn't resolve like a non-harmonic tone, then it's harmonic.</p>
<p class="text">The second chord starts to get more interesting.  This is an Ab major chord... but <em>all</em> of the notes of the scale are present.  The Cm9 chord at measure 1 has 5 out of 7 notes, but this one has all 7.  It's an AbM13#11.  But I don't feel like the F is harmonic.  The line in the melody goes Eb F Ab G, so I hear the F as a passing tone from the Eb to the G, but the G has an appoggiatura (the Ab is certainly in the chord, but it's an appoggiatura regardless due to how it resolves to the G).  So I'm calling this a bVI9#11 instead of a bVI13#11.  It's worth noting that the #11 is a very pretty note without the 7 but a melancholy note with, and that's the effect that we get here.  The Eb, G, and D in the strings are held over from the previous chord, making the music sound ethereal and... underwater, with the sun shining through.  It's very evocative.</p>
<p class="text">The third chord, all the way in measure 10, is a iv11, a pre-dominant 11th chord.  This, you'll recall, is a fairly common use for this chord, since the 11th resolves by staying put in the next chord, where it's the root.  At least, that's the case when it's a ii11.  The iv11 doesn't would ordinarily not work that way, but in this case, it does, because it still resolves up a fourth to bVII.  Now, we might notice a pattern: the Ab is missing from the Cm9, but the next chord is an Ab chord.  The Ab chord is kind of missing the F (not completely, but... mostly), and the next chord is an F chord.  Well, this F chord is missing the D, and the next chord has a D in the bass.  This F chord has every note except for the D.  There's another reason why, too: to avoid dissonance.</p>
<h4 class="question">Um, if David Wise wanted to avoid dissonance, why not just use triads?</h4>
<p class="text">Triads are too clean.  He wanted complexity, but he didn't want it to be harsh.  The D in the Ab chord is the most dissonant this piece gets.  All of the dissonance here is essentially non-harmonic dissonance.  In the C chord, you have a relatively consonant m7 chord, where the 7th doesn't really need resolution, plus a dissonant 9th, but that 9th wants to resolve up to the b3 <em>within the same chord</em>.  In the Ab chord, there's again a relatively consonant M7, with the dissonant #11 that wants to resolve down to the 3, the 9 that wants to resolve down to the 1, and the actually non-harmonic 13 that goes up to the 7.  The Cm9 chord has no tritone at all, while the Ab9#11 has a tritone where one of the notes is the root of the chord and the other note wants to stay inside the chord.  Contrast this situation to a dominant 7th, where there's a tritone between the 3 and the b7 that wants to resolve to 4 and 6, in a <em>different</em> chord.  For the F chord to not have a tritone, it would have to drop either the D or the Ab, and since the Ab is the crucial b3 and the D is the distant 13, the choice is easy to omit the D.  The result is still dissonant, but not in a way that has any forward motion.  The 9 wants to go down to the 1 and the 11 to the b3, but the chord is resonant and doesn't need to go anywhere else on its own.  David Wise has effectively removed the directionality from these chords.</p>
<p class="text">The iv chord, finally, at measure 12, makes its way to a bVII6.  This chord is difficult to describe with Roman numerals, since it's a 13th chord in first inversion that is missing its 7th!  The 764 symbol is not standard by any means.  In pop notation, the chord would just be written Bb13/D.  Again, this chord has had its tritone removed — no Ab — but we know it's a Bb chord rather than a D chord because it goes to i rather than v.  This is clearly bVII, a dominant-type chord, and not a ii, a pre-dominant-type chord.  By using a bVII rather than a V, or even a v, David Wise has removed even more directionality from the progression, making it feel more like floating underwater, perhaps in a coral reef, possibly in some sort of caper.  Or possibly a city of clams, or a chase of croctopodes, or fucking Poison Pond.</p>
<h4 class="question">The underwater levels of DKC1 weren't <em>that</em> hard.</h4>
<p class="text">Yeah, I know.  Stop and Go Station was way harder.  But still.  Anyway.</p>
<p class="text">This bVII6 chord is also introduced by the 11th of the iv11 chord, a common tone with the root.  The C, which is the 5th of the iv and the 9th of the bVII (7 above the bass since it's bVII6), is also held in common in the strings, but as is common with major chords, the 11th is actually very dissonant, so the Eb in the iv chord goes up to the F in the bVII6 chord.  The 11 is still present in the melody — it's the first note — but it quickly resolves to the 3, still making itself felt as part of the harmony (or macroharmony) but not causing any strong dissonance.  The 13th, on the other hand, is treated very harmonically, approached and left by leap in an arpeggiated Gm triad.  The C in the melody resolves to the Bb (but not in the strings), and the second group of 16th notes also has an arpeggiated triad, a Bb.  Thus, this chord contains a Gm triad, a Bb triad, and a held C in the harmony, all at the same time.  The G, however, does not feel like the root since it's not given that sort of prominence.  Instead, it's the common tone back to the i chord when the harmony loops around.</p>
<p class="text">One of the main ways this chord communicates its placidness is by the omission of the 7th.  Normally, extended chords have a 7, but this one doesn't.  I'd almost call it a 6/9 chord (treating the Eb as non-harmonic), but the 6 is supposed to be relatively consonant, wanting to resolve down to the 5, while the 13 feels more complex than that.  This <em>is</em> a dominant 13th chord; it's just missing an important note.  That Ab would have made a tritone with the D, and together those two notes would have tended to resolve to Eb G, the b3 and 5 of the i chord, as a backdoor resolution.  This does not happen.  Instead, the 13th is a common tone and the D, in the bass, goes down to the i.  What might have been a tritone resolving to a third is now a perfect fourth resolving to a perfect fifth, a succession of two perfect intervals.  The deliberate lack of directional tension is almost palpable.</p>
<p class="text">It may sound like this piece is very static, but it's really not.  While the chords are using 5, 6, or even all 7 of the available diatonic notes, they're mostly sounding in the melody, which changes register and shape from chord to chord.  The harmony moves less, but the roots do change every chord, making the harmonic rhythm slow but quite existent.  What does happen, though, is that the extensions are held as common tones when going to the next chord, giving that feeling of harmonies diffusing into one another like monkeys on a reef.</p>
<h4 class="question">A-plus analogy.  Perfect clarity.  Great job.</h4>
<p class="text">Oh, you know what I mean.  David Wise wisely (ha) used chord extensions to change harmonies slowly rather than quickly, creating a slow but resonant and mysterious sound that is very <em>unlike</em> the chromatic directionality of Águas de Março.  It's almost like the anti-jazz.  Jazz, built on ii - V - I in various configurations, prizes chromatic lines in these cadences.  David Wise does that as well, just not in Aquatic Ambiance, where he manages to have a functional progression with as little forward motion as possible.</p>
<p class="text">After this serene introduction, the rhythm kicks in.  You get some percussion, some bass patterns, eventually even a melody (which is reminiscent of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izGwDsrQ1eQ">Careless Whisper</a> but uses motifs from the rest of his compositions for DKC — note that he shared compositional duties with Eveline Fischer, but they didn't unify the thematic material).  The rhythm definitely propels the music forward when it starts, but the intro stands alone as the truly underwater section of the piece.</p>
<p class="text">Before we move on, you should listen to the original again (not my shitty version) and try to think for yourself about what makes this piece good and effective and beautiful.  I've heard several remixes, including some by David Wise himself in other games (like the GBA DKC3 and Tropical Freeze) and to me they miss the mark completely: they <em>quote</em> Aquatic Ambiance, the melodies and chords, but the melodies and chords <em>aren't the song</em>!  We're spending our time analyzing them and understanding them, because they're important, but the music is so much more than that.</p>
<h4 class="question">Well, what else is it?</h4>
<p class="text">Look at <? sectionLinkShort('composition'); ?>.  Many thousands of people compose a kind of music known as EDM, <em>electronic dance music</em>.  They call it "producing" instead of composing, but they're really composing.  They can compose an entire piece using only a single chord simply by layering a beat.  Have a beat for four bars, then add another layer to that beat for the next four bars, then another layer, etc., then change one of the layers, then change another layer, and so on, until eventually you end the song.  All the while, you're making interesting sounds and danceable beats — <em>enjoyable</em> music — without really much of a harmony or melody.  You can throw in some repetitive melodic elements, but you don't even need to.  EDM is almost minimalist, in a sense.  Melody and harmony are certainly important aspects of any piece of music that has them, but although they are the <em>recognizable</em> parts of the song, they are not <em>the</em> song.  Quoting the melody and/or harmony from Aquatic Ambiance without the other elements — the beat, the orchestration, etc. — gives you something that is not Aquatic Ambiance but rather something else.</p>
<p class="text">Now, as you continue your musical explorations, try to keep an open ear for extended chords of all sorts.  Every piece of music uses them differently.  Some use them just for color; some use them for extra forward movement; some use them to <em>prevent</em> forward movement.  Remember also that <em>any</em> note can be part of <em>any</em> chord, if you believe hard enough.  We'll talk about that some more when we talk about harmonizing a melody.</p>
<p class="text">There are a few more aspects of harmonic function that I want to discuss before we move on from chords; here's the first:</p>

<h3 class="subsection-title" id="plagal-motion">9.6.4 Plagal and Other Motion</h3>

<p class="text">We know that the role of V, the dominant, is to go to I (or i).  We know that V can take extensions, like a V7 or V9 or V7b9, and we know that if we omit the root of those chords, giving us a viio or viiø7 or viio7, it's still essentially the same chord that goes to I (or i).  In modern music, we add to that list the v and its extensions (v7), as well as the bVII and the bVIIdom7.  We've even seen the bII, bvii, and vø7 chords in this role in phrygian dominant.  But there's one more possibility: basically every other chord.</p>
<h4 class="question">That's more than one possibility.</h4>
<p class="text">Duh.  To wit:</p>

<? createExample('plagal functions 1'); ?>

<p class="text">A <em>plagal cadence</em> is a cadence that goes IV - I or something substantially similar; we can generalize this to mean any cadence that has a pre-dominant chord going straight to the tonic.  Chord functions are fungible, so in practice this means ii and IV chords (and their minor equivalents) going straight to I (or i), skipping the dominant.  In classical music, this is sometimes called an <em>amen cadence</em> because a hymn would go on normally, and at the end, the choir would sing "amen" in this cadence.  We can see an example of this in measures 3-5, where measure 3 has a V - i, possibly signifying the end of the hymn proper, and the "amen" response is in the next two bars, the IV - iiø7 - I6 (note the Picardy third with the major I chord in a minor context).  In this case, the final tonic is even in first inversion, because why not?  However, the most common form of the plagal cadence is what we see in measures 1-2, a V - I cadence with a passing IV chord.</p>
<p class="text">However, in modern music, rock especially, the V - I cadence is shunned because it sounds too classical, and IV - I takes its place.  We often see progressions like in measures 6-7, with a IV/IV to lead into the IV.  There are even hybrid cadences, like the 11th chord in <? exampleLink('extension functions 1'); ?> measure 21, which is a combination of both a V - I and a IV - I at the same time.  Therefore, when we think of IV chords, we should keep in mind this alternate possibility, as well as ii chords, though plagal motion is more common with IV.</p>
<p class="text">Nothing stops us from reaching the tonic via a mediant or submediant, either, though the diatonic mediant (iii, bIII) and submediant (vi, bVI) are quite similar to their respective tonics and therefore don't make for very satisfying resolutions.  In measures 8-9, we have iii - I, which kinda works because the bass and soprano both move, and the soprano moves from the leading tone to the tonic.  Same thing in measures 10-11, except that now we're in minor but we're borrowing the iii from major (the IV is part of melodic minor, since the raised 6th is going up to 7).  This makes the iii - i a <em>chromatic</em> mediant, a much more interesting resolution.  Measures 12-14 are a sequence, with the roots going down a third and up a fourth, ending in a bIII - i in minor.  bIII - I would have been a more satisfying chromatic mediant, but I gotta leave <em>something</em> for you to explore yourself, right?  Also I'd already done a Picardy third in measure 5 and I didn't want to do another.  bIII - i here uses the same concept as iii - I in measure 9, except that the leading tone is lowered, reducing the drive forward.  In modern music, of course, using the lowered leading tone is perfectly fine and normal.</p>
<p class="text">The submediant is a bit trickier to pull off because the tonic is a common tone, but that also makes it more plagal.  Since submediant chords <em>are</em> pre-dominant chords sometimes (like in bVI - V - i progressions), the vi - I and bVI - i <em>could</em> be considered plagal, but I think that's kind of a stretch for the vi - I and less so for the bVI - i.  Your call.  Measures 15-17 have a pretty cool set of secondary chords, with a viø7/vi (which could also be thought of as a viiø7/V resolving irregularly, but that would be silly, now, wouldn't it?), but the actual cadence has three notes in common and the bass leaps a sixth.  Maybe I could have written a better one.  Measures 18-20, on the other hand, are definitely better, because the b6 in the tenor of the bVI chord resolves by half step to the 5 in the i chord, a satisfying motion by half-step.  This could have easily been a chromatic mediant if I'd used the Picardy third, but eh.</p>
<p class="text">For the most part, Common Practice cadences stick to dominant-tonic relationships, maybe with passing chords (measures 1-2) or codas (measures 4-5 after the cadence at measure 3), but modern music is much less restrictive with chords resolving to the tonic.</p>
<p class="text">Finally, there's one more use of harmony I want to talk about, one that's been a fairly popular one on forums and such thanks to Jacob Collier's promotion of the concept.  I speak, of course, about:</p>

<h3 class="subsection-title" id="negative-harmony">9.6.5 Negative Harmony</h3>

<h4 class="question">Negative harmony!  That's, like, the dark world of harmony, the upside-down castle of harmony, the inverse of everything!</h4>
<p class="text">...No.  It's not.  It's a vaguely interesting little trick for generating harmony.  Basically, you just flip everything upside-down, so upward intervals become downward ones, etc., and you specifically do it so that the 1 and 5 switch places.  It's just like melodic inversion, except it's done with harmony <em>and</em> it's chromatic rather than diatonic.  If we're doing negative harmony in C, we reflect C to G and G back to C, and E goes to Eb and Eb back to E, so a C major triad becomes a C minor triad.</p>
<h4 class="question">...I'm confused.</h4>
<p class="text">Look at this image:</p>

<? createExample('negative harmony definition'); ?>

<p class="text">The first example is C E G, right?  You start at C, go up a major third to E, and go up a minor third to G.  For the negative of that, you start at G instead of at C, and you go down instead of up: down a major third to Eb, and down a minor third to C.  You take whatever is up from C and make it down from G instead, thus creating negative harmony.  The third example, the chords, are just a simple 3-voice progression going up, and the fourth example is the negative of that progression.  Every note has its negative equivalent: C is the equivalent of G, D is a whole step up from C so its equivalent is F, a whole step down from G; E is a major third up from C, so its equivalent is Eb, a major third down from G; F's equivalent is D, G's is C, A's is Bb, and B's is Ab.  So, if you turn this I - IV64 - V64 - I progression upside-down, you get i - v6 - iv6 - i64.  As a little side note, chord inversions in negative harmony will depend on which note is in the soprano in the positive harmony, not the bass, so there's nothing we can really say about how inversions map to each other.</p>
<h4 class="question">Oh.  That's far less revolutionary than random uninformed YouTube comments led me to believe.  So what happens if instead of mapping C to G and vice-versa, you map C to A?</h4>
<p class="text">Then you get negative harmony around the Db/Ab axis: C is a half step down from Db, and A is a half step up from Ab.  The C major chord becomes D minor under the negative harmony transformation.  The beauty of using this negative harmony concept is that the major tonic is mapped to the minor tonic and not some other chord, so the tonal center is still there.</p>
<p class="text">Here are a bunch of chords and their negative harmony equivalents (still in C, but shifted an octave to make it easier to read):</p>

<? createExample('negative chords'); ?>

<p class="text">These are just the diatonic chords; of course you can go farther and turn chromatic chords like aug6's upside-down as well (interestingly, Fr+6 becomes FrV).  Major triads map to minor triads (and vice-versa — all mappings are two-way, since you just turn the music upside-down, which means that if you turn it upside-down again you'll just get back the original), but diminished triads map to diminished triads and augmented triads map to augmented triads.  If we remember the mapping note pairs, things become easier to comprehend: C <-> G, Db <-> F#, D <-> F, Eb <-> E inside the fifth, and Ab <-> B and A <-> Bb outside the fifth.</p>
<p class="text">The next thing is that we'd expect that if the F major chord maps to G minor, then other F chords will map to other G chords.  This is <em>not</em> the case.  We <em>hear</em> the bass as the most important note, but it's the <em>soprano</em> that determines the bass of the mirror chord.  The FM7 actually maps to EbM7, not to a G chord.  Speaking of which, 7th chord flavors are interesting: M7 <-> M7, m7 <-> m7, dom7 <-> ø7, o7 <-> o7, mM7 <-> M7#5.  Furthermore, a chord with extensions can become essentially <em>anything</em> in negative harmony.</p>
<p class="text">Another thing that flips upside down is the mode.  Major turns into minor — that's actually the point, partly.  It's really a little more and a little less than that at the same time: the major scale upside-down is actually the phrygian scale, but if we want the tonic chord to stay as the tonic, the major scale on C actually maps to the phrygian scale on G, which is the natural minor scale on C when we use the right tonic.  But the normal minor scale sometimes has a raised 6th and 7th, so the melodic minor scale actually maps to a kind of melodic <em>major</em>, which is major where the 6th and 7th are <em>lowered</em> when descending (because G A B C maps to C Bb Ab G).  The situation is even weirder with phrygian dominant, because we now have vii chords in the mix.  Ordinarily a vii chord would probably indicate that a modulation has happened, but upside-down phrygian is actually lydian, which does have vii chords, and when it's phrygian dominant upside-down, that's a weird scale: melodic minor #4.  Or lydian b3.  I don't know.</p>
<h4 class="question">Very interesting, but why is any of this <em>useful</em>?</h4>
<p class="text">I mean, it's kinda not?  But it gives you a new way to deal with harmonic function.  There's a 19th century principle called <em>harmonic dualism</em>, which is the idea that minor is essentially an upside-down major (so negative harmony is not in any sense <em>new</em>).  We can extend this idea to come up with new and interesting ways to relate chords while still retaining some aspect of functionality.  Let's see what happens when we just take some simple progressions and turn them upside-down:</p>

<? createExample('negative functions 1'); ?>

<p class="text">Here we have some simple phrases in major together with their negative images.</p>
<h4 class="question">What's this deal of "rectus" and "inversus"?</h4>
<p class="text">Bach's Art of Fugue has two fugues, Contrapuncta XII and XIII (the last two that were actually finished, since Bach died while writing XIV), that are played both right-side-up and upside-down, though the upside-down versions are inverted diatonically, not chromatically (they're inverted in the key of D so D goes to A and A goes to D, but F stays still, and the 6th and 7th are raised or not raised appropriately, etc.).  You can check out multiple editions on <a href="https://imslp.org/wiki/Die_Kunst_der_Fuge%2C_BWV_1080_(Bach%2C_Johann_Sebastian)">IMSLP</a>.  The right-side-up fugues are labeled "rectus", meaning "right" in Latin, and the upside-down ones are labeled "inversus", meaning "inverted" in Latin.  I decided to adopt the same notation here, because why not?</p>
<p class="text">Unlike Bach's work, though, my short phrases don't necessarily sound <em>good</em> when turned upside-down, since the bass generally follows different rules from the upper voices, so for some of the phrases I also tried to re-voice the inverted chords.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 1-2 have a very simple I - IV - V7 - I.  If you look back at the table, you can see that I - IV - V - I would translate to i - v - iv - i; the mode changes to minor and the subdominant and dominant switch.  This converts an authentic cadential motion, V - I, to a plagal one, iv - i.  In this example, the V chord is actually a V7, which is a chord extension.  Chord extensions are above the triad when expressed in thirds, so in negative harmony, they have to go below.  This means that the V7 actually maps to a iiø7.  We omitted the fifth in the V7, so the iiø7 has no third.  The arranged version just cleans up the voice leading a bit to take out those weird octaves, and I tried as well to highlight the resolution of the tritone from the iiø42 to the i (which is just like the one in the backdoor cadence, bVIIdom7 - i).</p>
<p class="text">This example teaches us something important about harmonic dualism (which, just so you know, is a <del>crock of shit</del> possibly not-very-useful theory), which is that plagal motion is upside-down authentic motion.  When we eventually talk about the overtone series, we'll discuss otonal and utonal harmony, where the otonal side has the major triad and the dominant, and the utonal side has the minor triad and the subdominant.  Problems with this theory include that it's poetic and symmetrical and <em>wrong</em>, but if it helps us understand music a little better, it's worth learning about it.</p>
<p class="text">Next, in measures 7-9, I wrote a phrase that is more amenable to inversion, with consistent spacing and chromatic bass and soprano, so there was no need for an additional arranged phrase.  Now that we've accepted that iiø7 is the upside-down dominant, V7/IV - IV turns into iiø7/v - v.  The interesting chord here is the Fr+6, which turns into a FrV; however, the tonal logic here breaks down, because the FrV goes to the tonic.  Here's where the shenanigans happen: the V becomes the iv, so Fr+6 - V becomes FrV - iv.  That's an irregular resolution, right?  Wrong, because this iv is actually a iv64, a cadential 64, which goes to i (via a passing tone, making a iiø42, but whatever).  I know, I am clever!  Of course, if I hadn't resolved the phrase and just left it at the V, making a half-cadence, the upside-down version would feel a <em>lot</em> less resolved.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 13-14 and 17-18 are examples we've seen already, with cto7 chords.  The first resolves to a I6 and the second to an added 6th chord in first inversion, which I labeled I6add4.  This cadence is essentially pre-dominant (ii7) to tonic (I6) with a passing chord (cto7), which is plagal, so you'd expect the inversus to be authentic, and it is: v7 - i with a passing chord.  The passing chord doesn't have a function, tonally; you could call it cto7/v, perhaps.  I decided to leave it as vo7 (well, vo43, but whatever).  The second half of the example, with the added 6th chord, demonstrates one of the basic principles of negative harmony, which is that added notes fuck everything up.  In this case, it's not so bad, because the added 6 becomes a b7, and the chord doesn't change function.  But if it had been something else...</p>
<p class="text">Measures 21-22 we have some borrowed chords and an irregular cadence by root motion of a third, I - bVII - bVI7 - I.  The inversus sounds... awful.  i - ii is fine, but the bVI7 turns into I7, which really doesn't go to i very well.  iii - i, sure, that's a chromatic mediant.  If the bVI7 had been a bVI triad, it would have worked.  But with the I7, I7 - i is just a very weak cadence, since the root doesn't move and there's nothing that's unstable enough to really resolve.  The arranged version in 25-26 attempts to hide those problems by treating the 7 and the 3 as appoggiaturas to the 1 and b3, respectively.  Does it work?  Eh, I can't really say that it does?  But it's at least a little better.</p>
<p class="text">Finally, measures 27-28 have secondary dominant extended chords, in a quasi-sequence, no less.  Let's see how <em>they</em> fare.  The first chord is a 7b9, which consists of a diminished 7th chord with a major third below it.  The dim7 chord is symmetric, which means that its negative image is also a dim7 chord, but the major third below it is now a major third above it.  Since we're doing this in the key of C and A and Bb map to each other, this chord bounded by A and Bb will turn into <em>another</em> chord bounded by A and Bb, so we can see the differences.  A C# E G Bb becomes A C Eb Gb Bb.  It's a weird chord, a diminished 7th with an added b9.  The most straightforward name I can come up with for this non-standard chord is o9.</p>
<h4 class="question">Wouldn't o9 have a major ninth instead of a b9?</h4>
<p class="text">You'd think so but that would create an augmented third between the bb7 and the 9, which is pretty weird.  A minor third above the bb7 would be the bb9, also known as the 1 of the chord spelled differently (at least in 12-tone equal temperament), so b9 is the only ninth that makes sense to add to an o7 chord.</p>
<p class="text">The next chord at 27 is a dominant 9th.  Now, the dominant 9th is 1 3 5 b7 9, so you can think of it as a diminished triad, 3 5 b7, with a major third below the 3 (the 1) and a major third above the b7 (the 9).  This means that, when you turn it upside-down, you get a diminished triad (it's symmetric — boogie woogie woogie) with a major third above it and a major third below it: in other words, another dominant 9th chord.  But once we start getting into extensions, stuff starts getting weird when you flip it over, not to mention that the voice leading, which generally has dissonances resolving down, here has everything resolve up instead.  The only way I could think of to make sense of this mirror progression was to think of the second chord, which is a bIIIdom9 in second inversion, as a substitute bVII chord, so the Ao9 chord can actually be a secondary viio9 chord to that bVII that doesn't happen.  This is motivated by the fact that V7b9 inverted does become viio9, and ii inverted does become bVII, so it makes sense for V7b9/ii to become viio9/bVII.  It's the bIIIdom9 that makes less sense, but hey.  The third chord, the viio9, is just like the first, and thanks to the voice leading, the image of the I9 actually feels like a tonic i chord despite having a 4 and a b6.  Any note tends to be tonicized by the note a fifth above, and in this case, you have a 1 in the bass and a 5 in the soprano, so yeah, that 5 is going to strengthen the hell out of that 1.  This makes this chord a i11b13 as opposed to some sort of iv9 chord, in my opinion.</p>
<p class="text">The arranged version takes a different tack: that bIIIdom9 chord goes into root position, and the notes of the first viio9 chord get rearranged to make this make sense.  The second pair of chords gets the same treatment, so now the F is in the bass in the final chord, and this whole phrase is better interpreted in F minor as opposed to C minor.  The first chord of each pair is now an appoggiatura chord with a bunch of non-harmonic tones as opposed to "real" chords, so the progression is just bVIIdom7b9 - i9 in F minor, With Stuff™.</p>
<h4 class="question">With Stuff™?</h4>
<p class="text"><a href="http://www.ctfws.org/">With Stuff™</a>.</p>
<h4 class="question">"Rock-Scissors-Paper plus Stuff makes Magic: the Gathering."  Heh.</h4>
<p class="text">We used to play CtFwS at <a href="http://www.vericon.org/">Vericon</a>.  Back when there <em>was</em> a Vericon.  We even got George R. R. Martin one year!  I miss Vericon.</p>
<p class="text">Anyway.  Hopefully you see that negative harmony can generate some interesting harmonies as well as complete garbage.  Let's see some examples phrases in minor now:</p>

<? createExample('negative functions 2'); ?>

<p class="text">Measures 1-2 have your ordinary i - iiø7 - V - i phrase.  Its negative is similar to what we've seen before: I - V7 - iv - I.  Remember that the negation operation switches dominant and subdominant, so the resulting phrase is pretty similar: the iiø7 becomes V7 (just like V7's we've seen have become iiø7's), and our T - PD - D - T phrase becomes plagal, T - D - PD - T.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 7-9 have a more interesting minor phrase, which is similar to <? exampleLink('negative functions 1'); ?> measures 21-22, but with a more logical resolution, bVI7 - V - I (with the Picardy third) instead of bVI7 - I.  bVI7 still maps to I7, so it's still a tonic chord where it might be a bit unexpected, but the difficulty is mitigated here because instead of bVI7 - I, which maps to the very weird I7 - i, the V is inserted, which maps to iv.  This has another benefit, because in minor, the V chord is normal, but in major, the iv chord is borrowed from minor.  Since the major I in the resolution at 9 maps to the minor i at 12, what was a "happier" ending in 7-9 becomes a "sadder" ending in 10-12.  This kind of thing can feel a bit sudden, so the iv beforehand helps to introduce it.  I think it works out quite nicely.</p>
<h4 class="question">The voice leading is weird, though; why didn't you arrange this one like you did in measures 5 and 6?</h4>
<p class="text">I couldn't get nine measures to fit in a single system, so I'd lose the organization of one phrase per line.  Sorry.  You can rearrange it yourself, if you'd like!</p>
<p class="text">Measures 13-14 show a raised 6th as well as a V7 chord with two different thirds.  How do these translate to negative harmony?  The viø7 is a fairly weird chord, but if you recall that the bVI7 maps to I7, it's easy to see that the viø7 maps to the Idom7, or V7/IV.  It turns out, though, that the V7#9 (which, as you'll recall, is not really a #9) only works because of the specific scale degrees involved, so when you turn it upside-down, it... doesn't.  In measure 16, I analyzed the 6 and 7 in the bass as passing tones; in measure 18, I treated the 7 as part of the chord, the 6 as an appoggiatura (actually, an accented passing tone, but same thing), and the bass note as a pedal.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 19-21 have two features, a Ger+6 and a cadential 64.  The Ger65 becomes really interesting, and this is a chord that might be worth using in general.  It <em>sounds</em> like a FrV with a minor third instead of a major one, but <em>really</em> that minor third is a #9!  Yep!  Unlike the #9 chord in 14 that's actually a b3, this b3 is actually a #9.  It resolves just like an aug6 chord on the b2 normally does, to I.  Here, though, we had a i64; what happened to that?  Funny thing: intervals with the bass are now intervals with the soprano, so inversions stop being meaningful.  The cadential 64 does not translate at all to negative harmony, because inversions don't translate at all.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 25-26 have a Neapolitan chord.  This one's interesting, because the bII becomes a vii.  It doesn't sound very functional, but who cares?  In first inversion (as in measure 29), vii6 can be used in a similar manner to viio6, bVII6, V64, and v64, as a passing chord on the 2.  It calls to mind the lydian scale.  You do lose the feel of two major chords a tritone apart when you mirror them, though, because, especially with the V7 rather than the V, the images, vii and iiø7, are not major chords and they're not a tritone apart.</p>
<p class="text">We'll now see some examples of negative harmony that bring something much more... <em>new</em>:</p>

<? createExample('negative functions 3'); ?>

<p class="text">Phrygian dominant is interesting, because the cadential mechanism in phrygian is different: b2 - 1, 4 - 3, and b7 - 1.  The cadential mechanism in major and minor is 7 - 1 and 4 - 3 or 4 - b3, so the b2 - 1 makes it different.  When you invert the major/minor cadential mechanism, you get b6 - 5 and 2 - b3 or 2 - 3, which is plagal but serviceable.  When you invert the phrygian mechanism, you get #4 - 5, 2 - b3, and 6 - 5.  The problem is that the chord with the 2, #4, and 6 is the dominant in the key of the V, and #4 - 5 accentuates that particular motion.  The result is that the negative of the phrygian cadence is a V - iv in the key of the dominant, but it doesn't sound like much in the key of the tonic.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 1-2 are your standard I - iv - vø - I complete phrase in phrygian dominant.  Its negative is i - V - V/V (or IIdom7) - i.  The only way to really deal with that IIdom7 is to treat it as some sort of passing sonority, because otherwise it just doesn't make sense.  In measures 5-6, you can just skip right over the IIdom42 chord in measure 6 and the phrase makes sense as i - V6 - i, but the IIdom42 has an anticipation of the 1 in the bass, an upper neighbor to the 5's in the tenor, a (chromatic) lower neighbor to the 5's in the alto, and a continuation of the 2 in the soprano.  This chord would almost be at home in a piece by Chopin.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 7-8 don't fare so well.  This one is an Andalusian cadence, iv - bIII - bII - I, but with a 7th on the bII as well as a dominant pedal.  Ooh, crunchy.  Well, its negative...  V - vi - VM7 - i, with a tonic pedal on the VM7.  That chord is 5 1 2 #4, though, so it could either be interpreted as a major 7th on the V with a tonic in the middle and no third, or, making <em>far</em> more sense given the tritone present, it's a IIdom7 with a pedal dominant.  Given the first two chords, this second interpretation makes by far the most sense, placing this entire phrase in <em>G major</em> rather than C minor.  The chords are a simple phrase in major now: I - ii - V7 (with a pedal tonic) - iv.  Sure, that iv would want to resolve to I, because it's otherwise a total surprise.  The tonic <em>shouldn't be a surprise</em>.  The music should feel <em>restful</em> on the tonic.  If the tonic is a surprise, well, then it's not the tonic right now; you've modulated!</p>
<p class="text">Measures 13-14 work a bit better.  This one has less motion in the middle, with bII - bvii7, where the second chord is the first chord with a note added.  In the rectus, this added note is the root, changing the function of the chord from bII to bvii, but in the negative, it isn't.  The bII becomes a vii, and the bvii7 becomes vii7, not very different from the vii.  Usually the way to make the same chord sound different is to just use an inversion, because that changes the bass; that's what happens in 13-14, but when this is turned upside-down, in 15-16, the bass is now the same.  That's not enough motion!  The rearranged version in 17-18 takes care of that, switching inversions.</p>
<p class="text">I think the sound of 17-18 is pretty cool, honestly.  I wouldn't call it functional, exactly, but it's tonal enough.  What it's missing, though, is the strong directionality of 13-14.  The bII chord really wants to go back to I; it's harmonically tense not because of the intervals it contains but because of its place in the scale.  In contrast, the vii has none of the excitement of the bII.  It can go back to i, but does it want to?  Does it even care?  Eh.  It sounds cool enough, but it has no forward momentum.  Perhaps if the tonic had been established for more than just one chord, it could do something, but for that to happen, the passage would probably need to not be in negative harmony.</p>
<p class="text">After all this, I think we got a pretty decent view of how negative harmony works — or rather, how it fails to work.  This negative harmony experiment gave us a sense for what aspects of functional harmony are based on intervals and what aspects are based on other things, like scale degrees.</p>
<h4 class="question">So wait, if it sounds like crap, what's the point?</h4>
<p class="text">What sounds like crap (and that's only subjective anyway) is not negative harmony itself; it's the upside-down versions of chord progressions that sound good right-side-up.  What you can do is use elements of the upside-down without actually living in it.</p>
<h4 class="question">Ah, so you use it selectively.  I suppose there are stranger things in harmony.</h4>
<p class="text">Exactly.  We know that the inverse of the V7 is the iiø7, but if you have I - IV - V7 - I, you can decide to flip just the V7 and make I - IV - iiø7 - I instead, leaving the other three chords in place.  In a piece of music, you might use the I - IV - V7 - I some of the time and flip the V7 at other times, or you might just use the iiø7, which nobody would be able to identify as negative harmony without the positive version next to it anyway.  This concept of negative harmony allows you to <em>understand</em> chords as related by a reflection.  It's a tool for <em>understanding</em> things and getting new ideas for composition, and, like all tools, it needs to be used with a hearty dose of reality as opposed to being some sort of blanket transformation.</p>
<p class="text">I should also mention that Jacob Collier's negative harmony is just one of many possibilities regarding flipping stuff upside-down.  If you look at <? exampleLink('negative functions 3'); ?> measures 9-12, we analyzed those in G, but if you're writing music in C and want a negative that goes to the wrong key, just transpose it!  There's nothing stopping you from doing that.  In general, flipping a passage in C around the C - G axis (which is technically the same as flipping it around Ed or At in 24-TET) will <em>mostly</em> keep it in key, but for a passage like measures 7-8, you can flip it around C.</p>
<h4 class="question">How would that work?</h4>
<p class="text">Any interval above C becomes an interval below C instead.  So C <-> C, Db <-> B, D <-> Bb, Eb <-> A, E <-> Ab, F <-> G, and F# <-> Gb.  Enharmonically, this means that the C and F# stay the same (but may move octaves).  C major, C E G, maps to C Ab F, F minor.  In measures 7-8, we have F minor, Eb major, DbM7 (with dominant pedal), C major; its image under a reflection about C would be C, Dm, G7 (with tonic pedal), Fm.  Make that Fm a cadential 64 that resolves back to C, and your Andalusian cadence becomes a simple classical phrase structure.</p>
<p class="text">You can also, of course, flip melodies upside-down, or even polyphonic passages.  Bach does this all the time, and we've already discussed the concept of melodic inversion in <? exampleLink('Contrapunctus I subject'); ?> and <? exampleLink('Contrapunctus III subject'); ?>.  You can do this around any note or axis.  But the beauty of negative <em>harmony</em> in particular is all of the new sounds you may not have thought to use, like the o9 chord, upside-down versions of aug6 chords, and so on.  My reason for discussing it here was not to shoot down harmonic dualism but rather to show you how you can generate new harmonies and harmonic functions from existing ones.</p>
<p class="text">Now that we've spent, well, a lot of time exploring the different harmonic possibilities within functional harmony and extended tonality (though we've barely scratched the surface of <em>everything</em> that's possible), we should really get back to the task at hand: <em>analysis</em>.  Our next stop will be trying to figure out the chords in a piece when they're not written out.  Should be fun!</p>

<h4 class="question">Finally!</h4>
<p class="text">Um, sorry, we're not there yet.</p>
<h4 class="question">What?  This sucks.</h4>
<p class="text">We'll get there eventually, because before you decide to write anything, you need to have a handle on who you're writing for — the <em>medium</em> — and the general kind of style of your composition — the <em>genre</em>.</p>

<? createTableOfContents($label) ?>

<h3 class="subsection-title" id="medium">8.2.1 The Medium</h3>

<p class="text">The <em>medium</em> is just who or what is going to play your piece.  Examples are a symphony orchestra or a rock band or synths.  You'll want to pick that first because it will affect all of your other decisions, and oftentimes the choice may be forced upon you.  For example, I could write a duet for tuba and violin, but then my a cappella group won't be able to sing it.  Composition competitions (you can find several online) often specify the instrumentation available.  When your product is sheet music, you also need to give some thought to the skill of potential players, since with sheet music you have to worry about the market for your music.  Who will <em>want</em> to play it if it's too difficult or too easy?  That's not a rhetorical question; that's a question you'll actually want to answer if you plan on actually having people play your music.  You might very well just not care about that and write compositions for their own sake.  Up to you!</p>
<p class="text">If you actually care about the piece being played, though, you need to pick an instrumentation that makes realistic sense.  If you have a band, or if you're composing music for your own performance, you have your answer right there.  Note that you can always decide later on to change the instrumentation.  That's often a big deal, but it's possible.  Sometimes it's pretty trivial.  For example, if you're writing a song for your rock band with electric guitars and you realize that you actually prefer the acoustic sound for this song, that's a change in instrumentation, but assuming you <em>have</em> acoustic guitars (and know how to play them), there's not much to change.  You'll probably want to rework some of it to fit the new sound, though.  On the other hand, if you think that it would actually work better as a string quartet, that's probably a bigger ask.  You could have the guitar play a CM7 chord with a particular strumming pattern, but it just wouldn't be the same on the viola.</p>
<p class="text">If you decide to write for orchestra, wind or symphonic or chamber, you'll want to make your music versatile enough to fit different sizes of ensemble.  Orchestras may have varying numbers of instruments, and it may be a stretch for them to accommodate your specific instrumentation.  In the 19th century, people did a lot of experimentation with orchestra composition (as in, the composition <em>of</em> the orchestra), especially as new and improved instruments were invented.  Mozart, for example, didn't generally include clarinets in his orchestral pieces.  He's famous for some of his clarinet solo music, but his symphonies (other than Nº40) didn't feature the instrument.  This was in the late 18th century.  A hundred years later, there were serpents, ophicleides, tubas, tenor tubas, euphoniums, sarussophones, etc., all vying for the right to fill the low range in the wind/brass section of the orchestra.  Plenty of composers had to figure out whether to include saxophones in the orchestra, too.  Eventually we settled on the current formats.  We'll talk in more detail about them in when we talk about orchestration, but to give a general feel for it, this is what a symphonic orchestra generally looks like:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Woodwinds:
		<ul>
			<li>2 or 3 flutes, one possibly doubling on piccolo (or a separate piccolo part), optionally an alto flute</li>
			<li>3 Bb clarinets (possibly doubled), one possibly doubling on Eb occasionally, preferably also a bass clarinet</li>
			<li>2 oboes, one possibly doubling on English horn (or a separate part)</li>
			<li>2 bassoons, one possibly doubling on contrabassoon (or a separate part)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Brass:
		<ul>
			<li>4 horns (unless you're playing Mahler and need 8); horns 1 and 3 are high and 2 and 4 are low</li>
			<li>3 trumpets or cornets (there's a difference)</li>
			<li>3 trombones, one possibly doubling on bass trombone</li>
			<li>sometimes there's 1 tuba</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Percussion (and other stuff):
		<ul>
			<li>0, 1, or even 2 harps</li>
			<li>sometimes 1 piano</li>
			<li>1 timpani</li>
			<li>other percussion as needed (snare drum, bass drum, cymbals, glockenspiel, xylophone, etc.)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Strings:
		<ul>
			<li>some arbitrary number of violinists playing Violin I</li>
			<li>some arbitrary number of violinists playing Violin II</li>
			<li>some arbitrary number of violists</li>
			<li>some arbitrary number of cellos</li>
			<li>some small but arbitrary number of basses</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="question">Why are there small numbers of woodwinds and brass compared to strings?  And why did you leave strings for last?  Where's the saxophone?  The guitar?</h4>
<p class="text">The saxophone and guitar are not standard orchestral instruments.  Really fancy orchestras may have saxophone and guitar players on call for when they play a particular piece that requires them, like Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue and Ravel's Bolero (if they play the latter, they'll also want to hire a robot percussionist for the snare drum part, because humans tend to get pretty bored with it), both of which feature an alto sax.  Additionally, a piece could call for a soloist playing really any instrument, regardless of whether it's generally in the orchestra, and what usually happens is that the orchestra hires a soloist, who sits up front, dresses in different colors, takes a separate bow and gets better flowers, etc.</p>
<p class="text">As for the strings, that's just how it goes.  Strings tend to have a weaker sound that becomes much warmer in large groups, so the standard convention is to have a limited number of woodwinds and brass and have whole seas of string players in front of them.  I don't know why they show up at the bottom of the score; that's just the score order for an orchestra.</p>
<p class="text">We will talk more about the specifics of the orchestra (and other ensembles like the wind orchestra) in a later chapter.</p>
<p class="text">Writing for orchestra isn't actually that hard if you understand how the orchestra works, but if you don't, you can always write for small ensembles, something usually called <em>chamber music</em> when done in the Western art music style.  Standard chamber ensembles include the string quartet (2 violins, viola, cello), the woodwind quintet (flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, horn — yep, the horn's a brass instrument, I'm aware), and the brass quintet (2 trumpets, horn, trombone, tuba).  You can always have non-standard ensembles, too.  If you're writing vocal music for a small number of singers, that's also chamber music; it's not limited to instrumental ensembles.</p>
<p class="text">Outside of Western art music, your possibilities are more limitless.  You can write for a Dixieland combo or a klezmer band or a rock band or a blues band or a big band or whatever the hell you want.  Of course, it will depend on what you have available, as always, but there's often the possibility of convincing some other musicians to join you (often by the means of exchanging currency).  Your rock band could always hire a horn section (which would generally include a few trumpets and trombones, maybe saxes, but not actually any horns).  You could even find a dude off the street to play more cowbell for you.</p>
<p class="text">Whatever you decide for the instrumentation, it <em>will</em> constrain your creativity.  You can only do what's possible, after all!  But once you do settle on a medium, you can orient all of your creative efforts on that medium.  If you decide that what you want to write for is player piano, like American-Mexican composer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conlon_Nancarrow">Conlon Nancarrow</a>, then you can go and explore the possibilities of the player piano to their limits.</p>
<h4 class="question">What if I don't want to constrain my creativity?</h4>
<p class="text">Well, I don't know what to tell you, then.  But constraints are generally <em>very</em> creatively productive.  Starting from a blank page is always hard (you might even be tempted to copy John Cage and keep your page blank), but once you have any sort of nucleus to go on, you can crystallize your music around that nucleus and wind up with something instead of nothing.  Choosing a medium is giving shape to nothingness.  But if you're really creative, you might end up with some music in your head before you figure out the medium.  That's OK!  That's when you try to pin the medium down.  I've occasionally done that; I've come up with themes while just banging keys on the piano, and I've stored them away in my mind for later use in some piece where they may finally fit in.  Some ideas are sitting there in the void, just waiting to be given form.</p>

<h3 class="subsection-title" id="genre">8.2.2 The Genre</h3>

<p class="text">Along with the medium, you'll want to pick the category of music that your composition belongs to.  This can be... difficult.</p>
<h4 class="question">Do I have to pick a genre?  What if I don't want to be constrained by genre conventions?</h4>
<p class="text">You <em>really</em> don't have to pick a genre.  You don't have to pick <em>one</em> genre, either.  You can pick any number of genres, including 0.  But you should make your choice consciously if you can.</p>
<p class="text">Loosely speaking, your piece's genre is the set of conventions your piece adheres to.  These conventions are an excellent shortcut for both you and the listener to understand the music.  For you, it gives a ready-made framework that you can fill in with your own content instead of you having to design everything from scratch; for the listener, it gives a ready-made set of expectations that you can satisfy or deny as you see fit.  For example, you could decide to write a march for wind orchestra.  This is a very standard thing.  Marches generally have a moderate tempo with a strong duple beat (2/4, 4/4, or 2/2, usually; sometimes 6/8) meant to accompany... marching, and they also generally have a simple form: first strain, second strain, trio.  The first strain is expected to introduce the piece; the second strain is expected to be contrasting in some way; the trio is expected to be a fourth higher, more cantabile, and featuring countermelodies and high woodwind obbligatos.  If you want to write a simple, standard march, you've got your formula; Sousa and Fillmore wrote most of their marches following this formula.  If you want to write a march yourself, using the formula will help make your piece sound like a march instead of... something else.  You can also stray from the formula if you want; so long as you maintain enough elements of what makes a piece a march, you'll still be writing a march.  One of my own pieces, <a href="http://offtonic.com/music/brass.php#tolyo">Tolyo March</a>, returns to the first strain at the end of the second, in the subdominant, which is not commonly done; also, the trio goes up a minor sixth (from Bb major to Gb major) instead of a perfect fourth.  It's also for a brass sextet (2 trumpets, horn, trombone, euphonium, tuba) instead of a more standard contingent.  But despite all that, it's still a march.  I could even have interrupted the march beat if I had wanted to, added some random bars of 5/8 or 7/8 or whatever, and generally made a mess of things, and it would probably still have been a march!</p>
<h4 class="question">Aren't marches just classical music?</h4>
<p class="text">OK, let's take a step back.  What is genre?  It depends on whom you ask.  That's because "genre" can mean some totally different things to different people.  A listener of commercial-type popular music (not that there's anything wrong with that) may be familiar with the sections of a music store, or whatever exists online these days because music stores are now a relic of the past.  There's the genre of rap and hip-hop, the genre of electronic, the genre of pop, classic rock, country, classical, easy listening, jazz, world, Christian/gospel, soundtrack, etc.  It's important to realize that these are industry terms, not genres.  For example, "world" is a genre.  What in the fuck does that mean, right?  You're going to put Arabic maqam music in the same general bucket as Balinese gamelan music?  On another hand (there are many hands here), a member of a music subculture may see fairly sharp divisions where other people don't see divisions at all.  There's East Coast rap and West Coast rap, for example, and rap connoisseurs may be partial to one kind or the other.  On another hand, are those subdivisions really that important?  Sure, from a musicological perspective it's useful to distinguish between schools of rap, but are those differences meaningful enough or should musical tastes be determined by artist or even by song?  The discussion is unresolved.  You can use whatever divisions make the most sense for the things you're talking about.</p>
<p class="text">It gets worse when you want to classify artists by genre.  It turns out that classifying artists by genre is legitimately useful, but only because most artists stick within a single genre.  For example, DMX is a rapper.  He makes rap music.  If you know that a particular piece of music is by DMX, you know that it belongs in the rap genre.  But what genre is Weird Al?  He raps too — very well, according to rappers who have heard him on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpMvS1Q1sos">It's All About the Pentiums</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9qYF9DZPdw">White and Nerdy</a>, to name a few.  But he's also in the genre of... whatever the hell <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VuiBBX6aZA">this</a> is.</p>
<h4 class="question">Weird Al writes parodies, so his genre is comedy.</h4>
<p class="text">Actually, half of his songs are originals.  Generally style parodies, I suppose, but still.  And comedy's not a real genre of music.  It may be where Weird Al's music is categorized by music stores and services, but "comedy" doesn't describe the music.  I'd describe Weird Al's music as "popular music", even if it's not necessarily all that popular (except that it is, because Weird Al is awesome and everyone knows it).  Weird Al is certainly not the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7yfISlGLNU">only artist</a> making awesome comedy music, and outside of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PsnxDQvQpw">few cases</a> where pinning a genre on it is difficult, comedy music often transcends genres simply because it can.  If DMX decides to pivot towards country music, a lot of people invested in his traditional genre would have a problem with that, but if a comedy artist makes a country song, the fans would still love it.</p>
<p class="text">This brings us to Western art music — that genre we like to call "classical".  People who listen to it have come to expect a wide variety of sub-genres, which can be divided by era, instrumentation, form, etc.  A composer may write in numerous different genres.  J. S. Bach, for example, is famous for his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bbox4oi6HjA">fugues</a>.  And his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPN88O-LX70">chorales</a>.  And his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rG8ygHgyOs">church cantatas</a>, and his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nifUBDgPhl4">secular cantatas</a>, and his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sDleZkIK-w">keyboard suites</a>, and his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8-Algb3bQY">toccatas</a>, and his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P21qlB0K-Bs">Passions</a>, his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7F7TVM8m95Y">Mass</a>, his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcFHuUJE0mU">preludes</a>, his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYukikOyC8Q">Inventions and Sinfonias</a>, his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HSRIDtwsfM">concertos</a>, his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VOkrddp6M8">partitas</a>, his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUHQ2ybTejU">canons</a>, and I'm probably missing, like, ten more genres.  Even within a single work he jumped around in genres — the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lrb0dHKJBR4">Art of Fugue</a> contains a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QtKPMhhPoM">fugue in the French style</a>; his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sDleZkIK-w">keyboard suites</a> are sets of stylized dance pieces each in a different genre; his famous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nnuq9PXbywA">Toccata and Fugue in D minor</a> is... a toccata attached to a fugue.  All of Bach's music can be considered (in hindsight) to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroque_music">Baroque music</a>, which is a sub-genre of Western art music in general defined by being written between roughly 1600 and Bach's death in 1750 (though other Baroque composers don't necessarily sound like Bach; Bach wrote in a deliberately antiquated style, sometimes with instruments that were already old-fashioned in his time like the recorder).  Bach's fugues are quite different from, say, Shostakovich's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICW2Z9sdMts">fugues</a>; you can hear where Shostakovich was inspired by Bach, but the tonal language is completely different.  Shostakovich wrote in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernism_(music)">Modern period</a>.  So while we can classify Bach as Baroque and Shostakovich as Modern, actually each piece — and sometimes each section of a single piece — is in a different sub-genre.</p>
<h4 class="question">Shitiiit, do you actually expect me to listen to <em>all</em> of that?</h4>
<p class="text">Nope.  But you can if you want to, which is why I provided the links (feel free to find other recordings if you'd prefer).  Bach was a <em>very</em> prolific composer in a wide variety of genres.</p>
<p class="text">On the other hand, you have Sousa, who wrote <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-7XWhyvIpE">a bunch</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr0ZI3j-fT8">of marches</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7FD9PNpfpo">that all</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgABUZ4i9co">sound roughly</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOCxegQupMU">the same</a>, and Johann Strauss II who did a similar thing with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CTYymbbEL4">waltzes</a>.  Leroy Anderson is mostly famous for his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2LJ1i7222c">light</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwHEqx_3BYE">orchestral</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnHLKM8hQR8">music</a> (which I guess is still different genres).</p>
<p class="text">To get back to your question about whether marches are "just classical music", the answer is that Western art music is <em>extremely</em> broad.  It has limits, certainly, and interestingly enough, those limits will be different for different people.  You might make a distinction between "serious" Western art music and "pops", like music from movies and videogames, orchestral arrangements of popular music, Leroy Anderson's light orchestral music, but you almost certainly would not consider Queen's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ9rUzIMcZQ">Bohemian Rhapsody</a> to be classical, even though it shares many features of classical music (and it's... a rhapsody, which is a classical genre).  Because Western art music is so broad and its listeners generally listen relatively broadly as well, even if they only stick to a handful of well-known composers, it doesn't really make sense to <em>split</em> it into genres.  That is, a piece of music may belong to a genre or even multiple genres, but that doesn't <em>necessarily</em> separate it from other pieces not in the same genre.  Separating by time period makes more sense — for older music, which fit that division's paradigm fairly well, but not for modern music, which is all over the place.  Marches are a genre within classical music, sure, but they're not a <em>separate</em> genre.  And there are going to be people out there who consider marches written post-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwCuFaq2L3U">Berlioz</a> to not be classical music at all and be pops or something instead.</p>
<p class="text">That all brings us back to why we're talking about genres in the first place: <em>if</em> you want your piece of music to belong to a particular genre, however it is that you define your genres, you're going to need to study the genre!</p>
<h4 class="question">And how does one do that?</h4>
<p class="text">Well!</p>

<h3 class="subsection-title" id="genre-study">8.2.3 Genre Study</h3>

<p class="text">You do analysis.  Lots and lots of analysis.  It's actually incredibly difficult and, in many cases, it's just not worth it to go in depth.</p>
<p class="text">To start with, you find representative music in the genre.  This is the hard part, because there's just <em>so</em> much music out there.  For example, let's say I want to write some bossa nova, which makes some sense because I actually know quite a bit about the genre.  Obviously the best way to learn about bossa nova is to go to the masters, composer Tom Jobim and poet Vinicius de Moraes.  You get a pretty deep view by just going through their canon.  Except that you soon realize that the sound you're looking for is actually Toquinho on guitar, not necessarily Tom Jobim on piano, and also, a lot of the songs you thought were theirs are actually by other people.  So to Tom Jobim, Vinicius de Moraes, and Toquinho, you add Chico Buarque, Ary Barroso, João Gilberto.  What about Roberto Carlos; is his music bossa nova too?  Caetano Veloso, Milton Nascimento?  What about all those artists you <em>haven't</em> heard of?</p>
<p class="text">If you're one of those people with <em>extensive</em> experience in this particular genre, you can analyze a broad range of pieces to try to find commonalities.  But if you aren't, you have to make do with a more minimalistic approach: pick one song in the genre and analyze it, and repeat the process until you have some idea of how to proceed.</p>
<h4 class="question">Won't I just sound like that one song, then, instead of the whole genre?</h4>
<p class="text">Yes.  Well, only if you stick to it closely.  In practice, you're bringing all of your musical experience to bear on your work, in all of the genres you've ever encountered.  We'll talk about this a bit more in the next section, but when you compose, you're creating music; you're imagining things and making them real (in whatever sense your product is real).  You're not just blindly copying.  You <em>can</em> just blindly copy; I mentioned Weird Al earlier, and one of his consistent techniques is the <em>style parody</em>, where he studies some musician's style and writes his own music in that same style.  If you go through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Weird_Al%22_Yankovic_discography">Weird Al's discography on Wikipedia</a>, you can look at the track list for each of his albums and see what the style parodies are.  For example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqDBB0no6dQ">Pancreas</a> is a style parody of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UbNwhm2EX8">Brian Wilson</a>, following his music very closely.</p>
<h4 class="question">Wait.  That Pancreas song.  Why do I sense a disturbance in the Force?</h4>
<p class="text">It's weird, but Weird Al's pancreas attracts every other pancreas in the universe with a force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the distance between them.  Gravity goes as 1/<em>r</em><sup>2</sup>, but Weird Al's pancreatic force goes as 1/<em>r</em>, leading to stronger action at long distances.  Nobody knows why.  Luckily, this 1/<em>r</em> pancreatic force is weaker at short distances than gravity (and also only applies to interactions between Weird Al's pancreas and other pancreases), so pancreatic stars can't form, and the overall effect on the stability of the universe is negligible.  Still, it prevents a serious problem for theoretical physics due to Gauss's Law, since the pancreatic flux across a sphere centered on Weird Al's pancreas actually grows as <em>r</em>, leading some physicians to believe that there is actually a pancreatic field of some sort permeating the universe.  The main consequences of this for theoretical physics are chromatic reversal, reversal of gravitational polarity, and inverted length measurements, as well as the simultaneous inversion of all priority queues, causing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KThlYHfIVa8">everything you know to be wrong</a>, which is all you need to understand.</p>
<h4 class="question">Physicians?  You mean phy — you know what, never mind.  Forget I said anything.</h4>
<p class="text">Anyway.  If you wan to sound like a particular song or artist, you need to carefully analyze that music and then, in the immortal words of Tom Lehrer, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXlfXirQF3A">plagiarize</a>.  Plagiarize!  Let no one else's work evade your eyes!  Remember why the good Lord made your eyes, so don't shade your eyes, but plagiarize, plagiarize, plagiarize — only be sure always to call it, please, "research".</p>
<p class="text">But most likely you won't want to sound like a particular song or artist, and what you really want is to sound like yourself.  That's something you'll figure out as you compose more and more.  What do you like?  What do you not like?  If you're composing, you should have some ideas about this.  You'll then merge what you learned about the genre into those ideas to create your own style.  This is basically how genres evolve; every single artist who takes on a genre necessarily adds a unique twist to it.  Weird Al makes style parodies that are <em>supposed</em> to belong to artist-specific styles, but he does it because it's funny.  Most artists don't have any reason to stick to someone else's style so closely, but it does come up; when it does, it's called a <em>pastiche</em>.  For example, Stephen Sondheim made pastiches of various periods of American popular music in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qq-PlSO_SI">Assassins</a>, specifically to evoke the feel of each of those eras.  It's a useful skill to have as a composer; at the very least, it's good to be able to switch styles with agility.</p>
<p class="text">So let's do an example.  At one point I wanted to write some Brazilian-inspired music, so I figured it would be a good thing to analyze some bossa nova pieces.  Actually, whether it's actually bossa nova or not is kind of a moot point; I just wanted to write music that sort of sounded like the genre I had in mind, whatever you want to call it.  So I figured a good representative song would be a classic by Tom Jobim and Vinicius de Moraes, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfLarcYdAhw">Apelo</a>.  Which I later learned is not by Tom Jobim at all but by Baden Powell.  That's what you get for thinking you know things, right?  In this recording, it's performed by Toquinho on guitar and vocals, featuring Maria Bethânia on the second verse and a sonnet (<a href="http://www.viniciusdemoraes.com.br/pt-br/poesia/poesias-avulsas/soneto-de-separacao">Soneto da Separação</a>) recited by Vinicius de Moraes.  Take a listen, and see what you can learn about its style before going on.</p>
<h4 class="question">Analyzing...</h4>
<h4 class="question">...Analysis complete.</h4>
<p class="text">Great.  I mentioned the three verses; the first verse is in Gm.  You can figure this out by listening for the tonic and checking on a keyboard what that note is.  At least that's how I did it.  Intro and first verse are just Toquinho on guitar, until the bass and percussion come in 16 bars in.  The verse is 32 bars long and symmetric.  Second verse is in Em (same method) and is sung by someone else.  Third verse, the instrumental with the sonnet recited over it, is in Am.  What's going on with the keys here?  Clearly, Toquinho has a beautiful low voice that fits the melody well when it's in G, but Maria Bethânia's voice is lower, relatively speaking — she's singing in the tenor range — so they brought the key down to fit her voice.  Clearly, once you've changed keys for a verse, might as well do it for all of the verses.  Here's where a knowledge of the genre is useful: when there are multiple singers like this, it's quite common to change keys for the verses.  You would think that it's a practical matter just for this song, but if you listen to basically any recording of Chico Buarque's beautiful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPTOAYyt8BU">O Que Será</a> (if you want an alternate recording, find one with Milton Nascimento), you'll hear key changes for the verses, and not necessarily the same ones every time, either; it depends on the singers!</p>
<p class="text">Next, let's look at the structure.  I've done a transcription of the melody with block chords (meaning that I'm skipping the rhythm in the harmony) from <a href="http://www.bossanovaguitar.com/index.php?chords=apelo.html&album=Vinicius%20de%20Moraes%20En%20La%20Fusa%20Con%20Maria%20Bethania%20y%20Toquinho">some chord chart I found online</a> (one of my favorite websites for playing bossa nova on guitar).  These chords (which may not necessarily match this particular recording) are in Am, so I'm transcribing the melody in that key:</p>
<? createExample('Apelo melody'); ?>
<p class="text">The structure is very simple.  Each phrase is 8 bars and is made up of three smaller sub-phrases, all with similar rhythms.  In each phrase, the first two sub-phrases rhyme and have the same rhythm, and the third rhymes with its pair in the next phrase and ends on a longer note instead of two shorter ones.  First phrase asks a question (musically, not in the text); second phrase answers but leaves it open; third phrase asks more pointedly; fourth phrase answers more definitively.  Note that each verse is 32 bars and there's nothing that could really be considered a chorus; the last phrase is more intense than the others, but it's not a chorus.  Here, again, breadth of knowledge is useful, because bossa nova in general tends to have long verses full of text and no choruses.  The verses may have several distinct sections, with contrasting shapes and rhythms — Apelo does not — but relatively few bossa nova songs have an actual chorus.  Some do!</p>
<p class="text">The melody itself is quite simple, consisting mainly of one note and its upper neighbor.  In the first eight bars, for example, the melody just sits on an E alternating with its upper neighbor F, except for a D in the last part of the phrase at 6.  In the second eight bars, you have F alternating with G then landing on E, E alternating with F then landing on D, then D alternating with E and ending up back on E.  And so on.  Here, again, knowing many bossa nova songs helps, because while a few do have very simple and static melodies (Tom Jobim's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SD0LnNrBm8">Samba de Uma Nota Só</a> comes to mind), many have complex and range-busting melodies.  Having a static melody for the whole song is not a consistent feature of the genre, but chromatically moving chords under a static melody is a feature that does happen quite often in bossa nova, even if for just short sections.</p>
<p class="text">The chords are where the analysis becomes meaningful.  We will study harmonic analysis in a lot of depth in the coming chapters, but for now, we can still say some things about it.  First of all, if you tried to transcribe harmony from the recording I linked, you probably had a tough time.  These chords aren't as simple as chords in other genres (like Bach chorales).  I opted for the chords from bossanovaguitar.com, because I looked through offerings from other sites and I didn't like what I saw.  I had to modify the chord symbols to better fit the way I usually write them (and the tab for the Ebdim7 chord in bar 26 was actually off by a fret for some reason); I transcribed the tab from the chord symbols.  That's not necessarily the best way to play these chords or this song, but I think it's close enough; after all, we're studying the genre, not the guitar technique, right?</p>
<p class="text">These chords are mostly extended chords rather than triads.  There are a few Am triads, actually, but the chord sheet actually labels them as Am7 chords!  I went with the tab rather than the label, hence the discrepancy.  The chord voicings are almost exclusively four-note voicings.  Why?  Because you have four fingers available in the left hand to put on the frets.  In bossa nova, as you should hopefully be able to tell, the guitar is played finger-style, not strummed.  Four fingers in the left hand on the frets (thumb isn't used) and four fingers in the right hand to actually do the playing (pinky isn't used) mean that you should probably stick to four-note chords!  You end up with some characteristic chord shapes and voicings when you play the same kinds of chords over and over, which is one of the reasons why I picked this particular song to analyze: I've played enough bossa nova to know that the chords here are typical.  There are two main chord shapes for m7 chords, for example, one with the bass in the 6th string, like the Am7 in bar 1, voiced 1 b7 b3 5, and one with the bass in the 5th string, like the Dm7 in bar 7, voiced 1 5 b7 b3.  Other 7th chords are often simple variations on these two shapes.  You really get used to those pretty fast.</p>
<p class="text">The chords themselves are mostly functional but with strong chromaticism.  If you're familiar with bossa nova in general, you know that several songs have the same three chords as Apelo at the beginning, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8xnQZ86fN4">Corcovado</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tt7w1yhHPc">Insensatez</a>, both by Tom Jobim.  In A minor, these chords go Am7 - E(b9)/G# - Gm6, followed by some sort of resolution like FM7, D/F#, or, here in Apelo, Dm7.  Since the melody is a static E (alternating with its neighbor tone F, but really the E is the important note here), in the first chord we have A in the bass and E in the melody, then G# in the bass and E in the melody, then G in the bass and E in the melody (necessitating the Gm6).  When a chord progression has some notes that are static and others that move in a chromatic line, we call that a <em>line cliché</em>.  Line clichés are quite common in jazz in general, including bossa nova, which borrows a lot of concepts from jazz (you could even call it a type of jazz, but we'll get to why I think they're way too different for that).  Of course, not every bossa nova song has a line cliché, but all of the bossa nova songs I've mentioned so far — O Que Será, Samba de Uma Nota Só, Corcovado, and Insensatez, as well as Apelo, obviously — have it.  Technically, the line cliché is limited to when only one voice changes in the chord, so the bossa nova feature is more of a reharmonized line cliché than a plain one.  This particular reharmonized line cliché is helped by the parallel relationships: the root goes down a fourth from Am to E(b9)/G# and again from Gm6 to Dm7.  Even though the Dm7 doesn't fit in the line cliché very well (the D/F# in Insensatez fits better, but the melody in that song is different), it does fit this parallel structure, so it's a good subdominant end to the first phrase.  The A7b13 and A7 chords in bar 8 are just secondary dominants to this Dm7, giving it a little bit more motion without really going anywhere.  The b13 is a common extension of the dominant 7th chord in minor in this genre, and here it's actually more of a melodic device than a harmonic one.  Look at the outer voices in measures 7 and 8: D F to A F to A E.  The F is stable in the first chord and unstable in the second, so it needs to resolve in the third.  When a stable note is held over to another chord where it's unstable and then resolved, it's called a <em>suspension</em>; we'll talk more about those soon.  Suspensions are a quick and easy way to make chords more interesting.</p>
<p class="text">In the second phrase, we have the Dm7, the iv in A minor, resolve back to Am7 at measure 11.  In bar 10 we just have a iio - V - i to emphasize that transition; you could consider both of those chords in bar 10 to be <em>passing chords</em>, chords that are not structurally important to the harmony but just transition between other chords.  You could easily just play Dm7 for both bars 9 and 10, but this particular harmonization doesn't, which is more interesting.  The Gm6 in bar 12 is also a passing chord to the FM7 at bar 13, the bVI, which is heading towards the E7 at 15.  That E7 is actually an E7sus, which would resolve at the downbeat of bar 16 if the b9 weren't added at that point, which <em>then</em> resolves, in a similar F - E motion as we had back in bar 8.  The structural chords here are every two bars, so they're essentially Dm7 - Am7 - FM7 - E7, or iv - i - bVI - V, but there are passing chords all over the place — the Bdim7 - E7 between the Dm7 and the Am7 doing a iio - V - i, then the Gm6 between the Am7 and FM7 which is just scalar root motion (the roots go in a scale — I've had people not understand the term "scalar motion" before).  The interesting one is the BbM7 between the FM7 and the E7.  This one's the bII of the scale; what's it doing there?  Well, it's called the <em>Neapolitan chord</em> (in classical music it's usually in first inversion, making it the Neapolitan sixth chord, but this isn't classical music).  It's a chromatic alteration of the iio with subdominant function, usually in minor, and it goes to V.  The BbM7 here isn't so surprising because it comes after an FM7, the chord that's a fourth below.</p>
<p class="text">Third phrase, we start out like the first, with just one difference: the A7 at 22 isn't present at 6.  What's going on here?  The progression in the first phrase is steadily descending, and Gm6 - Dm7 works within that descending framework.  Here, Gm6 - A7 is clearly <em>ascending</em>, which is a reversal of that framework.  It ends up in the same place; the Dm7, but Gm6 - Dm7 is a relaxing resolution, while Gm6 - A7 - Dm7, along with the melody, actually grows the tension.</p>
<p class="text">Fourth phrase is a little similar to the second.  We similarly have Dm7 at bar 25 going to Am7 in bar 27, but this time the passing chords are different: instead of a iio - V - i, we have this Ebdim7.  We've talked about this back in <? sectionLinkShort('chords'); ?>; Ebdim7 is a <em>common-tone diminished 7th</em>.  It resolves <em>upwards</em> to Am7 — actually, the voicing has Am, not Am7, but that's for practical matters; the A in the top string is actually important here.  This Ebdim7 chord actually sounds a bit like a B7b9/D#, doesn't it?  The melody is an A alternating with its neighbor tone B, but if you think of the B as part of the chord, it becomes that B7.  It still behaves like a common-tone diminished 7th, though, but it gets a bit of extra consonance by having that B in the melody.  The FM7 at 28 isn't really doing much; it's just there to provide some motion that measure.  Then the verse ends with another iio - V - i.  That E7b9 chord is actually fairly interesting, because the G in the melody is the b10 (which in jazz we call a #9) making this more of an E7alt chord.  Now, if this were the end of the piece, measure 32 wouldn't be there (there'd be some sort of coda instead), but the assumption here is that this verse loops right back to the start, so this last bar is the <em>turnaround</em> (which we've discussed in the context of the blues).  It's just an E7 that resolves back to the Am7 at the beginning, but it's got extra stuff: the b9 is just a standard extension we see all the time, and the b13 is just a note that resolves, just like in bars 8, 16, and 24.</p>
<p class="text">Now that we know <em>what</em> the chords are doing, what can we learn from this knowledge?  Many people would say that we're already done with the harmonic analysis, but we actually only did the preliminary work.  The <em>actual</em> analysis is how we interpret the chord functions we've figured out.  In this case, what we want to know is what the general features of bossa nova are, with Apelo as a prototypical example.  How does Apelo's chord progression relate to other bossa nova songs' progressions?  To answer this, you obviously need to have a somewhat broad repertoire of bossa nova songs so that you can properly make generalizations, but the nice thing is that, once you've looked in depth at the chord progression for one song in the genre, you can hopefully pick out similarities with other songs without too much trouble.  The first really obvious similarity is that the chords are almost all 7th chords, dominant, major, and minor, with a few alterations and exceptions here and there.  Rock, for example, tends to have lots power chords and plain old triads, but anything jazz-influenced is likely to be full of 7th chords.  Part of that is the instrumentation choice; the classical guitar (used in bossa nova) is mellow but it has a crisp sound that supports the complexity of these chords, while the electric guitar's sound is generally harsher and makes complex chords sound too muddy to be useful.  But another part is just the style.  Chorinho, another genre of Brazilian music, doesn't add 7ths to every chord and uses the classical guitar as well.  Bossa nova's chords are therefore fairly distinctive.  Another thing we notice is, like in jazz, lots of iio - V - i and ii - V - I progressions, often as passing chords.  Other passing chords happen fairly often as well.  There's a preference we've already mentioned for line clichés.  All of these are features of bossa nova in general, and the more bossa nova music we look at, the better we'll get a feel for the harmonic language used.</p>
<p class="text">Just to give another example, the first eight bars of melody of Tom Jobim's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1tOV7y94DY">Águas de Março</a>, another song with a static melody, have approximately the following chords (key is Bb major): Bb7/Ab - Gdim7 - Ebm6/Gb - Bb/F - E9b5 - EbM9 - Ab13 - Bb6/9.  These chords are more complex than those in Apelo, but it's still the same kind of chords, for the most part: 7th chords and chords with extensions.  The only real exception is the Bb/F, which we may think is out of place, except that as a second inversion triad, it's not stable, so the chromatic line continues beyond it.  Other than the last two chords, by the way, the bass is entirely chromatic: Ab - G - Gb - F - E - Eb - Ab - Bb.  The Bb7/Ab chord can be thought of as a kind of weird I chord or as a V42/IV, a third-inversion secondary dominant.  The next chord, the Gdim7, <em>should</em> be a IV6 chord (first inversion IV), but it isn't; it's a common-tone diminished 7th used backwards.  I think that strains the bounds of functionality a bit, but that's probably OK, right?  The Ebm6/Gb is that IV we were promised, except that it's a iv instead, and it resolves back to I with the Bb/F.  In other words, we have a V/IV - IV - iv - I, a perfectly standard plagal cadence, except that it's been reharmonized out of recognition and the chromatic line is in the bass.  The next four chords are more difficult to interpret, but it's actually a rework of the same idea.  The fifth chord would be a V7/IV like the first, a Bb7, but it has been substituted by the dominant 7th chord a tritone away — called a <em>tritone substitution</em> — and turned into an E7 — actually, E9b5, but notice how E7b5 has the notes E G# Bb D and Bb7b5 has the notes Bb D E Ab — they're enharmonically equivalent!  So that E9b5 is a fairly simple transformation of a Bb7.  The next chord, the EbM9, is that IV chord we were promised.  Then we close with a bVII7 - I; IV - bVII7 - I is known as the <em>backdoor cadence</em>.</p>
<p class="text">You could argue that Águas de Março has a more sophisticated progression than Apelo, but I'm not sure that's a good argument.  They both use chromatic lines to make static melodies interesting, and they both harmonize those chromatic lines with complex chords in generally functional relationships if you fudge things enough.  While these chromatic lines are fairly common in bossa nova, it's the second part that's really generalizable: the harmonies are complex chords in generally functional relationships if you fudge things enough.  Bossa nova harmony in general can be explained this way.</p>
<p class="text">The last things I want to analyze in Apelo are the rhythms in the accompaniment.  The guitar does a thing where it plays a bass note pretty much every half note, and the other notes get played in this choppy, syncopated eighth note rhythm that changes at the whim of the player from measure to measure.  This is Toquinho's style, but it's pretty usual in bossa nova.  You also have the bass on the half notes with the occasional fill, and the percussion generally playing an eighth note beat on a shaker, hi-hat, light snare, etc.  What you will <em>not</em> find: any swung rhythms or any constant oom-pahs like in a rock beat.  Bossa nova rhythms have lots of syncopation, but the eighth notes are always straight.  Bossa nova pieces are also generally in 4/4, but there are a few here and there that aren't, like Tom Jobim's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuMJuufP5Tk">Chovendo na Roseira</a>, mostly in 3/4 with some odd bars, and Carlos Lyra's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y88EguvjlVM">Marcha da Quarta-Feira de Cinzas</a>, which is more march-style and in 2/4 with a dotted eighth rhythm.  In this recording, Toquinho's rhythm still has that syncopation but it's more regular and not always on the eighths.  For a completely different take on this, here's a recording by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3AXl-1YrCk">Elis Regina</a>, and another by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ujIZja_rIU">Carlos Lyra himself</a>.  The name of this song translates to Ash Wednesday March, so the 2/4 beat is actually a samba beat; the song is a subversion of the traditional Carnaval song, being about the sadness at the end of the holiday.</p>
<h4 class="question">So if it's samba, it's not bossa nova, right?  So why are we talking about it?</h4>
<p class="text">Because the genre boundaries are not so clear.  The song is played by groups that generally play bossa nova, using bossa nova instrumentation, but bossa nova is part of Brazil's national identity, so it happily incorporates elements from other strongly identifying genres like samba and chorinho.  Different musicians and composers play bossa nova in different styles; some make it sound more like a big band (with saxes, trumpets, etc.); some have a sparse jazz combo sound; some use something more similar to a choro ensemble.  Toquinho plays the classics on guitar with minimal backup; Tom Jobim plays piano and likes to have an alto flute in the ensemble as well.  Stan Getz is a tenor sax player.  Instrumentation is not standard in any sense, but it's also not, you know, a rock band.</p>
<p class="text">To finish out this section, I'll give you two more examples.  The first one is a bossa nova by bari sax player <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vVRTZnzpJc">Gerry Mulligan</a>.</p>
<h4 class="question">Chill tune.  Why does the video description mention Chopin?  Wasn't he that piano composer who died in... 1849?  He obviously didn't write a bossa nova piece.</h4>
<p class="text">Because, actually, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hj3daBN5F-o">Prelude No. 4 in Em</a> is basically bossa nova if you add some bossa nova rhythms.  The chords are pretty damn similar to the songs we've looked at, aren't they?  Gerry Mulligan is actually quite true to the original.  This goes back to what we talked about in the previous section, too, about the sound of the music: people will gladly listen to Mulligan play his bossa nova/jazz and think that Chopin's prelude sounds stuffy, and other people will gladly listen to Chopin's prelude and think that Mulligan is elevator music (makes riding elevators a lot more fun, if you ask me, at least until someone farts), but it's pretty much the same music.</p>
<p class="text">The last example is a brass piece I wrote after studying Apelo several years ago, <a href="http://www.offtonic.com/music/brass.php#haikai">Hai-Kai</a>, specifically the first movement.  It's not bossa nova, but I wasn't trying to write bossa nova.  I mean, it's in 5/8!  But it has the complex yet vaguely functional chords and the syncopation of the bossa nova it was inspired by, as well as plenty of my own ideas and other influences.  The instrumentation is a brass sextet, as required by the competition to which I submitted it (it didn't win): two trumpets, horn, trombone, euphonium, tuba.  One of the musical ideas I decided to explore in this movement was the concept of 6-note chords being versatile.  Say you have some chord, say D G C F B E.  Stack of fourths, right?  It's a good voicing.  This chord is a Dm13.  Bring the G down an octave, and now it's a G13.  Change that low G to a C, and it's now a CM13 (though admittedly it's not a great voicing).  The same six-note chord is an entire ii - V - I progression just by changing the bass note.  In practice, you don't want to do that because it's boring, so what I did in Hai-Kai was change the voicings just a little bit between chords.  They'd still have all the same notes, most of the time, just in a different order.</p>
<p class="text">I like the Hai-Kai example here because I <em>learned</em> something from Apelo and the bossa nova style but I didn't <em>copy</em> it wholesale.  This points out one of the pitfalls of making a musical pastiche: don't let the genre cramp <em>your</em> style.  You can still be creative even if you compose within a genre; you can still bring meaningful ideas into your genre music.  The great composers of that genre, whatever it is, are the creative ones; you don't have to sound exactly like them, just enough to keep the audience in check.  If the audience is expecting the blues, don't go in with hip-hop.  But a little bit of rapping over the blues may not hurt anyone, you know?</p>
<h4 class="question">So if I want to write music in a particular genre, how do I know what scales and chords to use?</h4>
<p class="text">What <em>scales</em>?  That's kind of a weird question.  Major and minor, generally.  Some genres do use certain scales more than others, but in Western music, nine times out of ten it's just your usual major and minor, possibly with a variable 7th degree depending on the genre.  As for the chords, you'll just have to do analysis — and your analysis will have to cover instrumentation, rhythm, melody, form, etc.  Harmony is just one element of a piece of music.</p>
<h4 class="question">What are the other elements?</h4>
<p class="text">That's a great question!  We'll get to that.  Before we do, though, I want to get into the very heart of this chapter: composition itself.</p>

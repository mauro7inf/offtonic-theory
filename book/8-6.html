<p class="text">And that's all I have to say about that.</p>
<h4 class="question">You have nothing more to say about composition?  I find <em>that</em> hard to believe.</h4>
<p class="text">...You got me there.  I could go on and on.  But, you know, if you wanted to read infinitely long treatises on composition, there's always Schoenberg.</p>
<h4 class="question">So what should I know about composition?</h4>
<p class="text">You should have some understanding of both the material and the creative processes that go into composition, as well as the various musical elements over which you have control.  So you should understand the differences between composing for sheet music, recordings, or performance, or other products like folk music, and be able to understand why certain elements matter for one but not for another, as well as what your role is in the creation process.  And you should generally know what kind of thing you're creating, right?  How much original work do you need to do?  You should know about style and medium and genre, and you should be able to analyze stuff if you want to write in a particular genre.</p>
<p class="text">You also ought to have a general sense of how one composes, and, to be honest, you should probably go and compose something right now.  Doesn't have to be good.  It may well be very good, but that's going to depend on how much music theory you already know, because we're still going to dive deep.  You should know about the decisions a composer has to make, and, if you're good, you should know the right choices to make, too.  That's the hardest part.</p>
<p class="text">Finally, you should be familiar with the musical elements available and how you can manipulate them to create interesting music, including removing the big ones entirely so that the small ones can shine.  And you should be able to recognize them when <em>listening</em>.  This is a big one.  You should never again find a piece of music boring because it has no beat.  A piece of music may <em>be</em> boring, but find some other reason, please?</p>
<p class="text">I think that's about it.  Try not to forget the words of the great Glenn Gould, who said this about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHW1I8T0caI">writing fugues</a>: "For the only way to write one is just to plunge right in and write one; just forget the rules and write one; have a try, have a try, have a try."  It's true for composition in general, not just fugues.  Everything I said is pretty much nothing but abstract nonsense if you don't have some actual composition to back it up.  Reading about composition without composing is like reading about music without listening.  You need to do it mostly in order to build a frame of reference.  This is going to start becoming more important in the coming chapters, where we're going to discuss some problems you may have come across while composing, especially the big one: how do you connect one chord to the next in a way that sounds good?  That and more to come!</p>

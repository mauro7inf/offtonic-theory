<p class="text">We have a shorthand that we sometimes like to use.  6/8 is annoying to write, with all those quarter notes and eighth notes.  Jazz musicians, on the other hand, are known to be laid-back and lazy.  In fact, that's what makes jazzy music appealing.  The beat is more relaxed.  So in jazz there's a special notation for writing quarter notes and eighth notes in compound meter instead of doing it the normal way.  In French it's called <em>notes in√©gales</em> and hails from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notes_in%C3%A9gales">some old tradition</a>, but in English it's just plain "swing".</p>
<? createExample('In The Mood swing'); ?>
<h4 class="question">Hey, now we're talkin'!</h4>
<p class="text">It gives the music a totally different feel, doesn't it?  Just for contrast, here's the exact same piece without the swing:</p>
<? createExample('In The Mood straight'); ?>
<h4 class="question">Meh?</h4>
<p class="text">Meh.</p>
<h4 class="question">Why does the tie at the end look different?  That weird curvy thing hanging from the last note; what's that?  What's up with the ugly triplet in the Swing 8ths description?</h4>
<p class="text">Sibelius.  It really gives you an appreciation for humans, doesn't it?  The weird curvy thing at the end is called a <em>fall</em>; it means to just kind of go down in pitch arbitrarily while fading out the note.  We'll talk some more about it next chapter.  The tie at the end is actually a slur, because the playback library can't do a fall on a note tied from an accented note.  In fact, it can't do a fall normally either; you notice how it gets restruck?  Granted, these are actually difficult problems to solve, so don't hate on them too much.</p>
<p class="text">Anyway, let's talk about this.  First, the instruction to swing 8ths is <em>Swing 8ths</em>, and the opposite is <em>Straight 8ths</em>.  The graphical description of what swinging 8ths means is optional, but note that one <em>can</em> do a lighter or heavier swing; this is jazz, after all.  You can also swing 16ths instead of 8ths (and not all jazz is swung).</p>
<h4 class="question">How do 16th notes even work if you're swinging 8ths?  Won't they get off-time?</h4>
<p class="text">The answer is that they don't work.  If you're swinging 8ths, you're not using 16ths.  On the other hand, triplets work fine; triplets would just be played straight (since the eighth notes are equivalent to triplets anyway), and they're used pretty often in swung music as a way to fill in the space between the eighth notes.  If you do see 16th notes, though, they're probably meant to be played too fast for you to care whether they're straight enough.</p>
<p class="text">There are some other features in this piece worth talking about a bit in the way of analysis.  Of course, we'll do much more analysis later; analysis is one of the primary goals of music theory in general.  By <em>analysis</em> I mean looking at music to understand what it's doing and why.  So here in the intro of Glenn Miller's In The Mood, a very famous piece, there's a lot of syncopation.  That's standard for big band jazz.  Right in the first and second bars, look at all those accented eighth notes on the offbeats!  Syncopation feels swingy and laid-back, which is why you see it so much.  There's more of that later: measure 5.  See that three-beat pattern, the A B A G E?  That repeats... but the measure is 4 beats and the pattern is 3 beats, so it repeats at a different point in the measure.  That's more syncopation.  End of measure 6, we have two syncopated notes, the E and the B, the E happening before beat 3 and the B happening before beat 4.  Naturally, you'd expect the next note to hit before beat 1.  But it doesn't.  Downbeat of measure 7 is right on the beat.  YOU HAVE TO WAIT FOR THAT.  Sing the piece and be early on that A; see how it sounds less powerful.  The swing, the syncopation, those are laid-back, but being on the beat is where the punchiness is.</p>
<h4 class="question">Sounds good.  Except, you know, the last note is early, which throws off your entire schtick.</h4>
<p class="text">That last note isn't meant to be punchy!  You see, it's not really the last note.  This is just the intro of the piece.  Those last two notes of bar 8, the two G's, are actually the pickup into the real melody that begins at bar 9.  And those last two notes repeat two bars later, and two bars after that they're G A instead of G G, and so on.  The actual last note <em>of the piece</em> is a very on-the-beat low G whole note.</p>
<p class="text">That being said, obviously jazz depends on notes both on and off the beat, so this isn't some general thing.  A good composer knows when to punch and when to just kick back.</p>

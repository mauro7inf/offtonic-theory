<p class="text">We've spent a lot of time (a lot of time) talking about aspects of different scales and modes, much of it in one specific and isolated context: pieces that are <em>in</em> a mode.  What does it mean for a piece of music to be <em>in</em> a mode?  It means that the piece follows the rules and conventions of the mode, whatever it may be.  For example, a piece can be said to be <em>in</em> maqam Oj if it has a Siga jins on its tonic and a descending sayr.  A piece is <em>in</em> major if it uses the relationships of the major scale.  But... what if it's not?  What if it doesn't observe the rules of a mode, or observes only some of them in some contexts, or some combination?</p>

<h3 class="subsection-title" id="modal-tonal">7.11.1 Modal, Tonal, Atonal, etc.</h3>
<p class="text">A piece of music can have a number of different relationships to a mode or a set of modes at different scales.  Scales as in time scales, not musical scales.</p>
<h4 class="question">Uh...  Huh?</h4>
<p class="text">I guess I worded that really oddly.  So let me just tell you what I'm talking about.  There are several ways to describe these relationships.  The first two, which we've mostly used in this chapter so far, are <em>modal</em> and <em>tonal</em>.  A piece that is <em>modal</em> is <em>in</em> a mode, and a piece that is <em>tonal</em> is in a mode that's organized around a tonal center.  This last one is a bit contentious given how Western music has traditionally been taught.  Students who study the Western classical canon sometimes tend to see music as a kind of progression, from the primitive plainchant of the Gregorians in a pretty much straight line to John Cage's 4'33" and its 20th century ilk.  At the beginning, it was one voice, and then people started using two voices in parallel fourths or fifths; then polyphony happened, and tonality happened, and Bach and Mozart and Beethoven and Mahler and Stravinsky happened, in that order, and then Schoenberg took away tonality and he with his modern composer buddies invented serialism and musique concrète and graphical scores and whatever passes for music these days, freed from the conventional chains of musical form or taste to be truly modern.</p>
<h4 class="question">Graphical scores?</h4>
<p class="text"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_notation_(music)">Don't ask</a>.  Though to be fair, even Bach did that a little in his Musical Offering.</p>
<p class="text">The relevant result of this view of musical history is that music using the "church modes" is primitive and <em>modal</em>.  I put "church modes" in quotes because this view of musical history doesn't differentiate between <em>modern</em> usage of "the modes" (referring specifically to the diatonic modes here) and <em>historical</em> usage of the actual church modes.  More general use of the modes other than major and minor (and I don't mean <em>natural</em> minor; that's modal too) is outside of this simplistic story.  In fact, non-classical music in general is outside of this simplistic story.  Music that doesn't advance or at least fit into the story is not music worthy of study.</p>
<p class="text">You can guess how I feel about this.  I enjoy "classical" music — a better term is <em>Western art music</em> — but great music doesn't need to fit into this absurd historical narrative that doesn't portray actual musical experience.  There's still great classical music being composed today, so why do orchestras program only long-dead European composers?  Why is film music and videogame music relegated to "pops orchestra" quality?  Why are almost all of the professional large ensembles 19th-century-style orchestras in the first place?  There's a sense that what is called "serious" music excludes anything that people actually like.</p>
<p class="text">So, for the purposes of this book, "modal" and "tonal" aren't stages in the development of music but actual useful descriptions of how music is organized.  Music that is <em>modal</em> is simply any music that's actually <em>in</em> a mode, and music that is <em>tonal</em> is any music that has a tonal center.  In the other way in which these two words are used, <em>tonal</em> music must be in major or minor, and furthermore, it must follow the conventions of functional harmony — this means, among other things, that b7 - 1 is not a valid melodic cadence in this more restrictive sense of tonal music.  When we want to explicitly differentiate between this restrictive sense and the more general sense of music having a tonal center, we say that the more general music exhibits <em>extended tonality</em>.  In this book I'm going to use "tonal" in the general sense most of the time, so I'll refer to the restrictive sense as <em>Common Practice tonality</em>.</p>
<p class="text">The definitions of "modal" and "tonal" largely overlap, but they don't in some important ways.  A tonal center implies that <em>every</em> note has a relationship to the tonic.  Secondary relationships are allowed too, but they're the exception and they're quickly resolved.  Most of the pieces we looked at in the first few sections of this chapter are tonal.  On the other hand, maqam music is not organized around a tonal center; really, only the jins is organized around a center.  A piece in maqam Bayat will have a tonal center on D for the first jins Bayat and a secondary center on G, the ghammaz, for the second jins Nahwand, as well as potentially other centers higher up or lower down in their own ajnas.  Furthermore, there isn't necessarily a sense of progression towards the so-called tonic even within a jins.  The tonic generally requires the fifth to be established, though you can get around this if you try hard enough.  Arabic maqam music pretty much doesn't do fifths, most of the time, so it abstains from actually establishing tonality.  Therefore, maqam music is generally <em>modal</em>, not tonal.</p>
<p class="text">Note that what we call "modal jazz" isn't actually modal.</p>
<h4 class="question">So why is it called that?</h4>
<p class="text">This form of jazz employs chord-scale theory, which we'll talk about in the next section.  In modal jazz, each chord is actually a scale, not just a chord, so instead of Do - G7 - Cm, you'd play some little melody or lick in D locrian #2, then something in G altered (locrian b4), and finally something in C melodic minor.  Or you could have a piece that alternates between measures of E dorian and D dorian for most of the piece.  Stuff like that.  This is jazz that is based on modes, hence the term "modal jazz", but it's not actually <em>modal</em>.</p>
<p class="text">Music can also be tonal without being modal, but usually we don't care.  I think that, for the most part, "tonal" is a subset of "modal", but in practice, we use "modal" only to describe music that is <em>not</em> tonal.  The reason is that we can easily make 12-tone music that is tonal, where every note has a direct relationship to the tonic without having to be "borrowed" from another mode.</p>
<h4 class="question">Borrowed?</h4>
<p class="text">Whoops, got a little ahead of myself.  We'll get to that presently.</p>
<p class="text">When we talk about mode in tonal music, the term actually means something slightly different from when we talk about it in modal music, and this is an important distinction.  If a piece of tonal music has a tonic on F and uses the scale F G A Bb C D Eb, we don't say that the mode is F mixolydian; we say that the tonic is F and the mode is mixolydian — in other words, we speak about mode generally rather than specifically.  In contrast, modes in maqam music and Gregorian chant have specific tonics/finals; the mixolydian plainchant mode has a final on G (though it could be transposed, but only in a very limited way).  How high the music sounds is part of the mode in this case, even if that's flexible.  But when talking about tonal music, we generally separate the tonic from the mode.</p>
<p class="text">Music that does not have a tonal center is said to be <em>atonal</em>, which generally implies a complete lack of tonal hierarchy.  If we want to talk about modal music that simply doesn't follow the behaviors of tonality, we generally say that the music is <em>non-tonal</em>, not atonal.  Music that <em>changes</em> tonal centers very frequently is <em>not</em> said to be atonal.  I personally call it <em>piecewise tonal</em>, since each small chunk is tonal even though that tonality changes.  Let's see what these are like.</p>
<p class="text">We talked briefly about Ligeti's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musica_ricercata">Musica Ricercata</a>, a set of 11 movements for piano, where movement N uses only N + 1 notes out of the chromatic scale (movement 1 uses only 2 notes, movement 2 uses only 3, etc.).  Much of Ligeti's music in general is atonal, but I figured I'd show you an actual melody that's atonal as opposed to just a general piece of music; this is the fugue subject from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwFMn2rPvqc">11th and final movement</a> of Musica Ricercata, which uses all 12 notes of the chromatic scale:</p>
<? createExample('Musica Ricercata XI subject'); ?>
<p class="text">The Wikipedia article has a decent listening guide for all of the movements, and you can find them on YouTube.  It's great listening.  This particular movement makes very frequent use of this atonal and highly chromatic fugue subject.  Since the movement starts on E, I labeled that pitch 0, but there isn't any sense of E as the "home" pitch.  The other numbers are just how many semitones up that note is from E, and you can see that all twelve notes of the chromatic scale are used, basically in order, though the melody goes both up and down.  Measure 4 is the beginning of the countersubject, which is a somewhat different set of material.  If you listen to the piece, you'll find that it's quite dissonant, but atonality does not have to imply dissonance.  You can have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psMLOlCxsFw">very pretty</a> atonal music too!  (That's another Ligeti piece because I like György Ligeti, The Alphabet, the third movement of his Nonsense Madrigals.)</p>
<p class="text">Our piecewise tonal example is <em>completely</em> different, Danny Elfman's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av78r69-w64">This Is Halloween</a> from Tim Burton's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nightmare_Before_Christmas">The Nightmare Before Christmas</a>:</p>
<? createExample('This Is Halloween'); ?>
<p class="text">What key is this in?  Obviously it's not... except that every little bit of it is in a key, just a different key each time.  When you jump to a new triad that's not closely related to the one you were on, that new triad often seems like the new tonic triad.  That's what this song does.  It's jumping to a new key very often, but in each of these cases, there <em>is</em> a tonal center.  It's just not present for very long!</p>
<p class="text">Singing atonal music is very difficult, because you don't really have a clear point of reference for you to find your scale degrees.  A piecewise tonal piece is not so difficult to sing, because even though you have to reorient yourself frequently, you do at least have <em>something</em> with which to orient yourself.</p>
<h4 class="question">What's up with the key signatures here?  In both pieces, really?</h4>
<p class="text">Atonal music generally doesn't get a key signature.  Why?  Because it's superfluous.  A key signature specified a tonal center, but there isn't one, so why are you playing every B as a Bb or whatever?  Piecewise tonal music often doesn't have a key signature either, but it makes a bit more sense.  Some composers do actually change key signatures every bar.  I find that incredibly annoying, personally.  I'd rather just see accidentals everywhere.  I just did it this way to demonstrate the key centers in the example.  By the way, this changing of keys frequently is a common feature in film and theater music, since it builds interest without making the music dissonant.  You can tell something changed, but the music is still pretty.  This is more common when people <em>aren't</em> singing, in order to keep melodies coherently tonal, but in shows with more abstract music like Sondheim's Sweeney Todd, this kind of thing does happen.</p>
<p class="text">Changing tonal centers and/or modes is generally known as a <em>modulation</em>.  We'll talk about how modulations work in a later chapter, but the fact is that you can do them as often as you want.</p>
<p class="text">A piece of music could also be in more than one mode at once.  If the modes share a tonic, the piece is <em>polymodal</em>; if not, it's <em>polytonal</em>.  When the number of modes/tonics is just two, you'd say <em>bimodal</em> or <em>bitonal</em>, accordingly.  Gustav Holst wrote a great example of bitonality in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrTOsJqB80">Hammersmith: Prelude and Scherzo</a>:</p>
<? createExample('Hammersmith'); ?>
<h4 class="question">Whoa!</h4>
<p class="text">I know!  This is one of my favorite pieces, and it's not because of all the clarinet solos.  Well, it's not <em>just</em> because of all the clarinet solos.  There's bitonality and polytonality all over the piece, but only at the beginning is it sustained and consistent.  You have a bass <em>ostinato</em> — that's a part that just keeps repeating over and over — in F minor, and the tenor voices come in with a melody in E major over it.  You'd think the effect would be horribly dissonant, but the beauty of the sparse part writing — just two voices — shines through in the implied harmonies.  I wrote the harmonies I hear in the first few bars; obviously everything here assumes enharmonic spellings.  Things start being interesting right away at measure 4; the first two measures clearly outline an Fm chord, so the downbeat of measure 4 sounds like F minor.  But beat 2 has B against G, which is G major; that's not related to F minor.  Next beat, B against Ab, which is Ab minor and that's not related to either of the two previous chords.  Fourth beat, A against C, which in the F minor context sounds like F major, especially given beat 1 of measure 5.  And so on.  The two voices make perfect sense individually, but put them together and some funky harmonies happen.</p>
<h4 class="question">Why are they so consonant?  I'd expect two tonics at once to sound ugly and terrible.</h4>
<p class="text">Because Holst was a great composer.  He avoids dissonant intervals.  The first time there's an actual dissonant interval is in measure 7, when the B goes down to A over the Ab, creating a minor ninth.  But that happens on a weak beat and the dissonance resolves (though in a kind of weird way).  There are three things going on in this piece: the bass ostinato in Fm, the tenor in E, and the combination of the two in weird-harmony-land.  Holst tries to keep things from getting too dissonant, but he lets the two lines go where they go and that creates the trippy harmony effect.</p>
<p class="text">By the way, it's been a long time since I've played Hammersmith myself, so I don't know how Holst approaches the key signatures.  I wrote each line in its own key signature to make the bitonality clearer, but I'm pretty sure Holst just didn't use key signatures at all in this particular piece, especially since the rest of the piece is far less consistent about the tonality than the introductory melody.  Actually, I think the piece may be in a different time signature too, like 4/2 or something like that.  Anyway.</p>
<p class="text">Music can also be <em>pandiatonic</em>, which is roughly atonality but within a scale that's not the chromatic scale.  Wikipedia has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandiatonicism">list of pieces</a> said to contain pandiatonicism, but the one that caught my ear is Steve Reich's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fruY31DQvb0">Tehillim</a> (link goes to the first movement).  In atonal music, structures that might accidentally establish tonality (like diatonic scales, triads, etc.) tend to be avoided in order to keep the music atonal.  Pandiatonic music doesn't generally need that kind of thing, and it tends to feature complex chords containing only diatonic pitches rather than functional triads (since that would be too tonal).  The pandiatonic label is not generally applied to pentatonic Japanese music or Indonesian gamelan music, but that music often works on the same principle, where no note of the scale is really the tonic, but only the notes of the scale are used.</p>
<h3 class="subsection-title" id="harmony">7.11.2 Harmony</h3>
<p class="text">How do you harmonize a piece in a particular mode?  You have several options.  The first option is the most basic: don't.  Don't harmonize at all.  You can do a little better than that by highlighting important notes in the melody on a bass instrument, and you can do even better by having another melody happening at the same time or switching off with the main melody.  Arabic music often works like this.</p>
<p class="text">The second option is the one most people think of when you mention modes to them: use chords built from the notes of the scale you're using.  The possibilities are interesting when it comes to some of the less diatonic modes out there.  Here are some of the chords available in C double harmonic:</p>
<? createExample('C double harmonic chords'); ?>
<h4 class="question">Looks like there are a lot more Db chords than anything else here.</h4>
<p class="text">Yeah.  So the first row is the triads formed by playing every other scale degree, and the second row is seventh chords formed the same way.  This is how we make chords in the diatonic scale.  But this isn't the diatonic scale, and you can see that several of these aren't triads at all.  The triad on B, in particular, has a diminished third, also known as a second.  So, if you accept misspelled chords, a whole lot of possibilities open up.  This is why Db is able to have so many chords.  If you spell things enharmonically, Db has its m3 E and it's M3 F; it has its tritone G and its fifth Ab; it has its m7 B and its M7 C.  This means that there are a whole lot of possibilities for Db as the root of a chord built on thirds.  I'm not sure if I got all of them, but I think I got most of them.  E has its minor third G and its major third Ab, so there are possibilities there too, but not as many.  Ab has two thirds but no fifth, and the seventh is an M7, so it's also a bit light on useful chords.  B has <em>no</em> thirds, which makes it problematic.  Of course, you can play non-triadic chords too; I just didn't list them here.</p>
<p class="text">These chords could be useful when harmonizing melodies in C double harmonic or any of its modes (like F Hungarian minor).  The great advantage of using chords like this is that you really emphasize the feel of your scale if all (or most) of your material comes from that scale.  I mentioned way back in <? sectionLinkShort('rhythm'); ?> that I wrote a setting of J. R. R. Tolkien's poem <a href="http://offtonic.com/music/other.php#luthien">Beren and Lúthien</a>, specifically in <? exampleLink('Beren and Lúthien first four lines'); ?>.  That example is in D dorian, and the harmony is also in D dorian exclusively:</p>
<? createExample('Beren and Lúthien first four lines', true); ?>
<p class="text">I even take advantage of the vio chord the first half of measure 7, the diminished triad in a kind of weird place in the scale.  I wouldn't call it functional harmony, but I do like how it sounds just so... <em>dorian</em>.</p>
<p class="text">The third option is to use harmonies from outside the mode.  This certainly weakens the modality of the piece, absolutely, but that's often desirable.  You don't <em>need</em> it to sound like it's in a mode, right?  This usually means that the piece isn't actually in a mode at all, but maybe the melody is.  And the piece can still be tonal (in the extended sense, at least).  The pentatonic and blues examples earlier in the chapter show this option very well.</p>
<p class="text">One incredibly useful technique, which we'll talk about later as well, is <em>modal interchange</em>, which is when you "borrow" elements of one mode when writing music in a different mode.  A great example is using bVI - bVII - I in a major piece, which is known as the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BsBXp6VkvU">Mario cadence</a>:</p>
<? createExample('Flagpole Fanfare'); ?>
<p class="text">The game in general is in C major — at least the main theme and the water level (<? exampleLink('SMB Underwater'); ?>) are in C major.  So when we get to the flagpole, we've been in C major.  But here are Ab major and Bb major chords; what's going on?  We'll spend a lot more time talking about modal interchange when we dive deeper into harmony, but for now, the main bit is that the Ab and Eb at measure 3 and 4 and the Bb at measures 5 and 6 are actually an excursion into C <em>aeolian</em>.  bVI - bVII - i is also called the <em>aeolian cadence</em> due to its use in music in the aeolian mode (but note that bVII - i doesn't fly in minor, which would use V - i).  The important features here are that the behavior of the bVI and bVII chords are the same as if the context were aeolian.  Simply using notes that belong to a different scale doesn't count as modal interchange; the <em>behaviors</em> have to be the same too.</p>
<p class="text">Oftentimes, pieces in extended tonality don't have a home mode in general, so they're immune to modal interchange — you can't "borrow" elements from another mode if you aren't already in a mode that lacks those elements!  I find that modal interchange is a terrible explanation for chromaticism most of the time.  We'll return to this discussion in a later chapter.</p>
<h3 class="subsection-title" id="chord-scale-theory">7.11.3 Chord-Scale Theory</h3>
<p class="text">Finally, we bring harmony and mode together.  <em>Chord-scale theory</em> is the concept of using scales <em>as</em> harmony.  We tend to associate chord-scale theory with jazz, but it's really used everywhere, just without people noticing it much of the time.  The idea is simple but powerful: changing from one scale to another can be thought of as a change of harmony rather than a modulation.  The tonic of the piece doesn't have to change, but instead, the root of the current chord can be momentarily thought of as the tonic of the scale, so if you're in C major and your chords are a simple Dm - G7 - C, you could think of these scales as D minor, G mixolydian, and C major, but you still hear C major as the general tonality of the piece.  (In jazz, you'd almost certainly use D dorian rather than D minor because of the way chord are constructed; the b6 sounds like an avoid note while the 6 does not.)  Remember when we talked about the stability of the scale degrees back in <? sectionLinkShort('scale degrees'); ?>?  The stability will change when the harmony changes, and that essentially means that the mode itself has changed.</p>
<p class="text">This principle is so powerful that it works in modal music too.  You can think of a change of jins in maqam music as akin to a change in harmony in tonal music.  Go back and look at any analyzed example in the maqamat section — like <? exampleLink('Habusha 92 7'); ?>, Moshe Habusha's Ps. 92 verse 7 in maqam Saba — and look at the analyzed ajnas.  That particular example begins with Hijaz on G, then Saba on E, then Nahwand on C, Hijaz on G, Saba on E, etc.  Each of these is basically a chord.  Just like changing chords allows for variety and function, changing ajnas does exactly the same thing.</p>
<p class="text">I first realized the chord-scale principle when I composed this little excerpt in my head, no idea how many years ago.  I've had some abortive starts at actually writing it out, but the idea is that it's an Italian-style overture, similar to the operatic works of Rossini or Verdi.  I never really got very far; it doesn't even have a decent name.  The instrumentation should be orchestral (wind orchestra, most likely), and the only parts I've really worked out are the melody and harmony, with some ideas about how the accompaniment should go.  So, I present to you... some sketch of a piece of an overture-like thingy.</p>
<? createExample('Braunstein Overture'); ?>
<p class="text">The rhythm here is pretty consistent, with the fermatas for emphasis until the piece picks up a bit more.  The ending is supposed to be into a new section in the parallel major that has a different rhythm entirely that is based on legato eighth notes, so the 5/4 bar prepares that new rhythm by making the pickup an eighth instead of a 16th and lengthening the last beat accordingly.  It might seem weird to change keys just for one beat like that, but it makes sense in context.  Or it would if the context existed; I haven't actually composed that next section!</p>
<p class="text">But the reason I bring this overture up here is in the pickups to measures 5 and 6.  Let's try to analyze the scales of the melody (kind of ignoring the D#'s, which is just a neighbor tone).  Measure 1 has an E7b9 harmony, and the scale is E phrygian dominant for the pickups.  We have the principal chord tones there, the E, the F, and the B, with the E in the bass on the downbeat.  Measure 2 is Am, and the scale is A minor.  That's actually the same notes as E phrygian dominant, since we're using the G# rather than the G.  Pickups to 3, E7b9 and E phrygian dominant again; pickups to 4, Am and A minor again.  But now it gets interesting.  Second half of 4, we move to A <em>dominant</em>.  Now we have an A7b9 chord, which uses the Bb in the melody of the pickups to 5.  The exact same melody happens at the pickups to 6, except now it's B natural.  Why the change?  The Bb is part of the D minor scale of the Dm harmony at 5, while the B natural is part of the A minor scale of the Am harmony at 6.  So even though the Bb isn't part of the Dm <em>chord</em> at 5, it's introduced in the pickup as part of the D minor <em>scale</em> to match that harmony.  The A7b9 harmony in the second half of 4 is also part of the scale switch to D minor (again, it's D harmonic minor, hence the C#).  The rest of the excerpt just repeats these chords/scales until the last bar, where the scale switches to A major (or E mixolydian during the E9 chord, but that's a preparation for A major).</p>
<p class="text">In most diatonic music, the scales corresponding to the chords used are all quite closely related to the scale of the piece.  In jazz, we have this system where we play the major scale over M7 chords, dorian over m7, lydian over IV chords, etc.  In non-jazz diatonic music, that's usually not the case; we play the major scale over major chords (I and IV, in major), the (harmonic or melodic) minor scale over minor chords (ii and vi) and the mixolydian scale over dominant chords (V).  iii doesn't really show up, in part because Common Practice music doesn't generally believe in the phrygian mode, and viio is the same scale as the V.  This does mean that if we're in C major, we're likely to come across Bb's over Dm and F chords, as well as C#'s over Dm's and G#'s over Am's.  It's not very common to see a B natural over Dm or F chords because of those modal implications.  On the other hand, while you don't generally see G's over Am chords, you <em>do</em> see C's over Dm chords, because ii is also pre-dominant and the 1 is an important note in the ii - V - I progression.</p>
<p class="text">Minor works fairly similarly.  Minor (melodic, generally) over minor i and iv chords, major over major bIII and bVI chords, mixolydian over bVII (because we've modulated to the relative major), and phrygian dominant (or mixolydian b6 to avoid the augmented second) over V.  You have a choice for iiø; locrian is the natural choice, but locrian #6 or locrian #2 are also possibilities.  Of course, Common Practice composers didn't really think in these terms, but we have the benefit of understanding modes and scales in a way that lets us apply them to music that adheres to Common Practice harmonic rules.</p>
<p class="text">Impressionist composers (big names: Debussy and Ravel) took the chord-scale principle to another level.  In some of that music, a wide variety of modes was used as harmony without reference to harmonic function.  My favorite example is Debussy's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXtsmV8LYs">Fêtes</a>, from his Trois Nocturnes.  Ravel did a four-hand transcription of this piece, which you can find on <a href="http://imslp.org/wiki/Nocturnes_(Debussy%2C_Claude)">IMSLP</a> and which I've excerpted below:</p>
<? createExample('Fêtes'); ?>
<p class="text">My high school wind ensemble played a band transcription of this piece as well, which is how I came to know it.  It's really a lot of fun, except for having to tongue all those damn triplets on clarinet!  The Ravel piano transcription is useful because it condenses the orchestral score into just these four lines, making it much easier to read.  He takes a few liberties with the texture to make it more pianistically appropriate, but that's how transcriptions usually go; something that was idiomatic in the original instrumentation may be very awkward in the new one, and details may need to be changed.  Ravel in particular was a master at transcription, both from orchestra to piano and from piano to orchestra.  Mussorgsky's famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pictures_at_an_Exhibition">Pictures at an Exhibition</a> was actually a piano piece, which Ravel expanded to the full orchestra we know and love today.</p>
<p class="text">I did a little bit of analysis here to show you where the scales come in.  Not everything is really in the given scale (the Piano I chords at the section beginning at 9, for example, don't stick to the scale of the melody in the Piano II part), but it's pretty close.  You can see that Debussy uses a range of scale materials as harmonies.  You can't really pinpoint a tonal center, but this entire section does have a key signature of four flats (the key signature changes almost right after the end of the excerpt), and most of the scales Debussy uses are close to this profile.  There's a bit of alternation at 5-8 between D phrygian (or F dorian; not all of the notes are present) and Db mixolydian (or possibly Db lydian dominant).  If we look further out, we can see a connection between the scales at 3 and 11 and the scales in 5-8: the scale at 3 has just one accidental (relative to the key signature), D natural, and the scale at 11 also has one, Cb.  The scales at 5 and 7 are compatible with the scale at 3, and the scales at 6 and 8 are compatible with the scale at 11.  There are some chords at 9 that are not best analyzed as scales, and the scales return at 11 with Ab melodic minor, not as an aspect of minor but as its own independent scale.  We get some whole tone fun at 15, some more whole tone fun at 19, and then the tempo slows to half and there's a little fanfare in Db lydian.  Which could actually be Db lydian dominant, the scale at 11.  So other than the two whole tone scales, most of this excerpt uses just two pitch collections, F dorian and Ab melodic minor, in various inversions.</p>
<p class="text">When we listen to a piece of music, in general, we really hear several notes at the same time.  We hear the notes currently being played, of course, especially the melody note.  We hear the root of the current harmony, which we could call the root of the current chord-scale.  We hear the tonic of the piece if there is one.  We compare all of these notes in our head to determine where we expect the music to go next; if we hear C as the tonic, D as the root of the harmony, and C as the melody, we expect that the C in the melody will resolve to B next, even though C is supposedly at rest as the tonic of the piece!</p>
<p class="text">But we don't just hear those notes.  We also hear the notes in the rest of the current chord-scale and in the scale of the tonic as well.  These notes contribute to our sense of harmony, and we call them the <em>macroharmony</em>.  A chord-scale is, in essence, the macroharmony surrounding a particular chord, which notes are considered compatible and which are out of the scale, etc.</p>
<p class="text">Chord-scales are also a good solution to the problem that some scales have of being harmonically static.  The lydian scale, for example, can't support a wide range of tonal harmony because it lacks a 4, having a #4 instead.  The #4 is a beautiful note, but it doesn't work as a center of stability as the root of a chord like the 4 does as the root of a IV or iv.  But maybe you really like the sound of the lydian scale.  What do you do?  You could just write really harmonically static music in lydian, or you could use a few lydian <em>chord-scales</em> here and there as momentary harmonies, or even as the tonic harmony, moving to some other scale when you need a break.</p>
<p class="text">Chords are how we think of music <em>vertically</em>, while scales are how we think of music <em>horizontally</em>.  Chord-scales help us make sense of those diagonal sections, I suppose!</p>

<p class="text">Ah, you did, sorry, I wasn't listening.  ARE YOU READY FOR THE END OF THIS LONG-ASS CHAPTER?</p>
<h4 class="question">That's a trick.  It's gotta be.</h4>

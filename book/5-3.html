<p class="text">Now that we've studied the intervals, we ought to be able to hear them and sing them, both ascending and descending.  I listed a characteristic song for each of them, but there are <a href="https://www.earmaster.com/products/free-tools/interval-song-chart-generator.html">lots more</a>.  There are <a href="http://flypaper.soundfly.com/tips/interval-cheat-sheet-songs-to-help-you-remember-common-intervals/">plenty</a> of <a href="https://www.musical-u.com/learn/interval-reference-songs-that-youve-actually-heard-of/#">sites</a> with this stuff.  It can be difficult to identify intervals, but if you start singing one of these songs you can compare it to the notes you hear, and from some starting pitch you can sing the song and figure out the next note in an interval.</p>
<h4 class="question">What's the point of doing this?</h4>
<p class="text">That's actually a good question.  If you want music theory to actually be useful, if you want it to be more than some abstract set of names of things, if you want it to be <em>meaningful</em>, you need to be able to put it on real music.  Ear training helps you do two things.  First, it helps you to hear a piece of music and understand what's happening in it.  Second, it means that you really understand the intervals, at least in your own way, and that's important for knowing when to use them.  Third, and most importantly, it helps you to see a piece of music written and understand what it sounds like.  As a bonus, you're ready to join any amateur singing group simply by doing that second thing.  If you can take a piece of sheet music and sing what's on it, you can sing.  You may not have a great voice.  You may have plenty of other issues.  But if you do that, you can sing.  It's not difficult, but there are enough people out there who can't that it's a problem.</p>
<p class="text">So, to start with, you're going to need to work on your singing.  This means: open up the <? appletLink('keyboard'); ?> and pick a note and an interval.  Now, sing that interval above and below the note.  If it's out of your range, just move the note up or down by an octave.  Do this for all the intervals.  You can click on one of the keys then drag your mouse pointer off of it; this way, the key turns on but not off, and you can just practice singing intervals with that.  You could even try to sing intervals other than the 12 intervals of the chromatic scale, if you're adventurous!</p>
<p class="text">It's good to practice this whenever you can.  When you hear a microwave or a car alarm, that's your chance to sing intervals.  Any drone or repeated pitched sound (SO NOT FUCKING JACKHAMMERS) is a great medium for practicing intervals.  Our ancestors probably discovered harmony by doing something like this.  They heard a sound — maybe a voice — and tried to sing with it, and they discovered that if they sang certain intervals they could make magic happen.  You can!</p>
<p class="text">The other thing you need to do, of course, is to be able to hear them.  To that end, I give you two applets.  The first one plays a drone and another note, and you have to figure out what scale degree that note is relative to the drone.  Click to start or stop; you hear the drone for two seconds and the note for four before the answer pops up.</p>

<p class="text">The second one plays a drone and two notes, and you have to figure out the interval between the notes.  The drone plays for two seconds, and then either one note plays for two seconds and the other for four, or both notes play together for four seconds.  This one can be pretty challenging!</p>

<h4 class="question">Dude, why is this so much harder than other ear trainer apps?</h4>
<p class="text">Because ear trainer apps don't usually give you context.  You get an interval and have to identify the interval, but all you're really identifying are scale degrees, because you hear the first note as the root.  Here, the root is not related to the other notes, so you have to think on your feet a bit more.  In other words, the lower note that the applet plays is not actually part of the exercise, but your brain doesn't quite realize it.</p>
<h4 class="question">Aha, so it's a trick!</h4>
<p class="text">It's not a trick.  In real music, intervals aren't nicely packaged.  You don't hear two notes alone and try to decide what interval they make.  Music (almost) always has context.  Ear training without context is like learning to how pronounce the letters one at a time and never learning about digraphs.  I mean, just look at the previous sentence.  "Time" has a silent E.  The A in "at" and in "a" are very different.  "Learning" has a rhotic "ea", which is unlike any of the other uses.  "Digraphs" has a PH, which is not a P plus an H.  Learning the intervals without context is like learning the letters without words (in English, anyway).</p>

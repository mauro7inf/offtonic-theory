<p class="text">It's best to start with an example.  Over the course of the next few chapters, we'll learn much more about the parts of the example and, obviously, look at plenty of other examples.  This example will be a Bach chorale, the very first chorale in the book I have that contains 389 of them:</p>

<? createExample('Bach Chorale Gesange'); ?>

<h4 class="question">What book is that on the music stand?</h4>
<p class="text">It's a collection of Bach's 389 chorales.</p>
<h4 class="question">No, not the book on the keyboard, the book that's open on the music stand.</h4>
<p class="text">It's a collection of Bach's 389 chorales.</p>
<h4 class="question">You photoshopped the open book into the background?</h4>
<p class="text">Yes.  ...No.  I just happen to own two copies of the book.</p>
<h4 class="question">Why?</h4>
<p class="text">Someone heard that I liked Bach and gave me the book as a gift, not knowing that it had been my college theory textbook.  I don't mind, though!  It's open on my music stand because I'm playing through some of the chorales.  My theory professor in college spoke of these chorales as mini-masterpieces, and I just thought they were boring, so I figured that maybe I should play them with open ears and an open mind.  Honestly, they're still mostly pretty boring, but there are a lot of things about them that I hadn't realized back in college.  Now, Bach spent much of his life (1685-1750) as a working musician, working as music director and organist in churches throughout Germany.  A lot of his music — a <em>lot</em> of his music — is functional in the sense that it has a particular ritual goal (it also uses functional harmony, but I'm not talking about that).  These chorales, in particular, are generally settings of existing hymn tunes, mostly Lutheran but some older, that Bach prettied up for his church service.  I've personally done very similar things with my a cappella group, taking an existing (and well-known) Jewish hymn and harmonizing it into a chorale so that people can hear and sing it in harmony.  My chorales are generally far simpler than Bach's (mostly because I'd much rather spend rehearsal time on something else, so I make them easy).</p>
<h4 class="question">What is a chorale anyway?</h4>
<p class="text">Ah, yes.  A <em>chorale</em> is a piece of music for voices that uses a mostly homophonic texture — all of the voices moving roughly at the same time, in harmony.  You'll sometimes see instrumental pieces labeled as chorales; those would be instrumental pieces that resemble or evoke vocal chorales.  Chorales can certainly be accompanied by instruments.  The 389 chorales in this book are arranged for four voices, soprano, alto, tenor, and bass.  I don't know if Bach wrote them all in that format already; there are a few where it's clear that they were edited for the book.  Sometimes there's an additional instrumental part or something.  But there's a reason we like to analyze these four-voice chorales: they're easy to analyze!  So, without further ado, here's the very first chorale in this book, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SyCA3I8gcA">Ach bleib bei uns, Herr Jesu Christ</a> (more information at <a href="http://www.bach-chorales.com/BWV0253.htm">www.bach-chorales.com</a>):</p>

<? createExample('chorale 1'); ?>

<p class="text">As you can see, I've labeled a bunch of things.  Let me tell you, getting the little numbers right in Sibelius is a pain in the ass.  That's why the Roman numerals don't look as nice as this in the other chapters.  But here, I figured I should actually be right, even though it takes forever.  There are three main things I've labeled: the Roman numerals for the harmonies (the first-level analysis), a second-level functional analysis, and some non-harmonic tones.  Most of these involve some degree of interpretation, and most of these have several different (incompatible) notations.</p>
<p class="text">Let's talk about the format first.  You should really hear it sung by voices at the YouTube link above, but I've included a synthesized recording by instruments that can sustain notes as well.  It may seem easiest to just use piano, but you lose many nuances with piano.  Measure 2 beat 2, for example, has the bass and tenor on the same note.  The piano can't play two of the same note at the same time, but different instruments can.  The different instruments also help aurally distinguish between the four voices (from the top, they're soprano with stems up, alto with stems down, tenor with stems up in the bass staff, bass with the stems down).  Sometimes, voices may cross, and if it's all piano, it's easy to lose track of what's going on.</p>
<p class="text">The Bach chorales in this book are all for four voices, SATB, but there's nothing preventing composers from writing chorales in three or five or six or ten voices, and many in fact do.  With fewer than three voices, it's not a chorale anymore.  Four voices is <em>usually</em> an optimal number, since you have enough voices to do what you want without being overly constrained.</p>
<h4 class="question">What would constrain you from writing with more than four voices?</h4>
<p class="text">Voice leading, which we'll talk about soon enough, as well as simply there being too many voices in the texture — they won't have enough room to move without getting in each other's way.</p>
<h4 class="question">How do they do it in orchestral music, then?  There are dozens of musicians!</h4>
<p class="text">The standard way is to just double up on the voices.  For example, you might have 17 violin II's, and all of them play the same alto part, sounding like one voice.  You don't need to hear each violin II playing separately.  You may even have voices doubling at the octave; the cellos may play the bass part while the string basses play the bass part an octave lower; it's still one voice, just... reinforced.  The other option is to just ignore the idea of independent voices in the first place.  In the Bach chorales, we have four clear and obvious voices, but if you take a Chopin prelude or a Beethoven sonata, chords may have different numbers of notes and nobody really pays attention to that because the voices aren't separable like they are here.  You can do the same thing in orchestral music and collapse or expand voices at will.</p>
<p class="text">Now, the labels!  The first set of labels are the P's and N's on some of the eighth notes.  The P stands for <em>passing tone</em> and the N stands for <em>neighbor tone</em>.  A passing tone is a note that's not part of the chord but connects chord members by step.  In the first measure in the soprano, the C# on beat 1 is in the chord (A major) and the E on beat 2 is in the chord (E major first inversion), but the D is not; that tone is used to pass from the C# to the E along a scale.  Passing tones can go up, like in the soprano in measure 1 beat 1, or down, like in the alto in measure 2 beat 1.  In measure 4 beat 3, the soprano has a neighbor tone, the A, which is the lower neighbor of the B.  A neighbor tone takes a step away from a chord tone and returns to that same note.  The A in the soprano in measure 4 is a lower neighbor tone (also abbreviated LN, but I didn't bother), while in measure 8 beat 3, the bass and tenor together have upper neighbor tones (UN).  There are certainly more non-harmonic tones we could label this way, but this chorale doesn't contain them.  It does have other non-harmonic tones that are labeled in the Roman numerals, though.</p>
<p class="text">We saw Roman numerals a bit back in <? sectionLinkShort('chords'); ?>, and here they are again.  They represent the chords in the key: I is the major chord on scale degree 1; ii is the minor chord on scale degree 2, etc.  First, we have the key, A.  We write major keys in capital letters and minor keys in lowercase letters.  I'm doing the same with the Roman numerals, but be aware that some people just use uppercase for all of the Roman numerals.  The Roman numerals indicate the function of the chord within that key.</p>
<h4 class="question">I thought the function was the tonic/pre-dominant/dominant/tonic stuff?</h4>
<p class="text">It's that too, but the word <em>function</em> can also describe the Roman numerals.  This is important, because we could have analyzed measure 2 as bVII - I - IV in A instead of IV - V - I in D (or IV/IV - V/IV - IV in A, which is effectively the same thing).  We expect I chords to act and sound a certain way — they have the I <em>function</em> — but the A major chord in beat 2 of measure 2 acts like a V in the key of D, not like a I in the key of A.  (You could, of course, disagree.  That's your prerogative.)</p>
<p class="text">The Roman numerals come with smaller Arabic numerals called <em>figured bass notation</em>.  Well, they're not quite figured bass, but they come straight from the practice.  In the Baroque period, composers would often not bother writing out accompaniment lines, just like lead sheets today.  There'd be just a bass line, and the 'comping keyboardist would just improvise something on the spot to fit that bass line.  It was like jazz but with less showing off, because this was an improv <em>accompaniment</em>, not solo.  (The soloist could improvise some stuff too, and that really <em>was</em> showing off.)  This keyboard part was called the <em>continuo</em>.  Now, how was the keyboardist supposed to know which chords to play?  There was a system of numbers that indicated the notes above the bass that should be played.  If you saw a 5 and a 3, for example, you'd play the notes a fifth and a third above the bass, forming a triad.  These were the notes in the key signature, so if you have F# and C# and you saw a D with a 5 3, that's a D major chord, but if you saw an E with a 5 3, that's an E minor chord.  You didn't see 5 3 very often, though, because root position triads happened so much that they didn't need to write the 5 3; you'd just assume that's what it was unless you saw something different.  A 6 was such an example.  The 6 was actually short for 6 3, so you'd play the note a third above and a sixth above.  If you're in D major and you see a D with a 6 under it, that means you play D, the third above which is F#, and the sixth above with is B.  This makes a B minor chord in first inversion.  And so on.  We'll talk about it more in depth in a bit.  When Roman numerals were introduced for analysis in the 19th century, they appropriated the figured bass notation from the Baroque period that ended a hundred years earlier and attached it to the Roman numerals.  The chord in measure 1 beat 2 would have been written as a G# with a 6 below it, so we analyze it as a V6, since it's a V chord (E major) that would have been written as a note with a 6.</p>
<h4 class="question">Wouldn't V6 be an E6 chord, E G# B C#?  I don't see a C#.</h4>
<p class="text">That's confusing.  Pop chord notation uses 6 to mean a chord with an <em>added</em> 6th.  We'd actually call that a 65 chord with Roman numerals; if there's just a 6, it's actually a first inversion triad.</p>
<p class="text">You should also notice some numbers with dashes between them.  These actually represent non-harmonic tones too... well, some of them.  In measure 1 beat 4 in the tenor, for example, we see that there's an E that's not in the chord, and that E resolves to the D, which is in the chord.  We call the E a <em>suspension</em>, which is when a note held over from the previous chord resolves late.  In this case, the suspended note is a 7th above the bass, and it resolves to the note a 6th above the bass; we denote this movement with a dash between the 7 and the 6.  The chord itself is a IV6 in A or I6 in D, not a IV7 or I7.  The 7 is not part of the chord.  You may notice that when I rewrote the Roman numerals in D, I left out the 7—6 thing.  That's because getting those to look right is a major pain in the ass and once was enough.  I'm sure you understand the intent anyway.</p>
<p class="text">The 8—7 is similar, except that the 8 is a chord tone and so is the 7.  At the downbeat of measure 3, the chord is V, and at the next eighth note it's a V7.  I could have just labeled them separately, but I think this is the more transparent analysis.  A similar thing happens in measure 4, except that the 8—7 motion takes longer and there's a 4—3 suspension happening on the same chord that resolves first.  Measure 7 has another 7—6 suspension in the alto, but the dash is on top of the V because I couldn't think of a less messy way to write that.  The same 8—7 motion happens in measure 6 beat 4, but since it's in the bass, I figured it made more sense to just write them as separate chords.</p>
<p class="text">Finally, the lowest line is a second-level analysis.  In this analysis, we group the chords of the piece into functional <em>regions</em>.  We don't label every chord; instead, we figure out which chords are really just there to embellish the central chord(s) of the region.  In the first measure, for example, we have I - V6 - I.  The V6 is essentially a neighbor chord that embellishes the I.  You can even see this in the voices: the chord on beat 1 is identical to the chord on beat 3, so beat 2 is just a momentary diversion.  The regions are generally T, PD, D, and T, in what's called the <em>phrase model</em>: T is tonic, PD is pre-dominant, D is dominant, and T is tonic again.  Not all phrases follow the phrase model exactly; the first line of this chorale does this modulation to the IV, generally a pre-dominant chord, but there's some glue in between the PD and the D that actually has a cadence to I at the end.  The second line actually has two phrases; the first one is in the first two bars and ends in a half-cadence on the dominant, and the second is complete.  You can <em>totally</em> disagree with how I did my second-level analysis, and that shows how the more actual analysis is involved, the more subjective it is.  I don't think it's correct to analyze the chord in measure 2 beat 2 as a I, and if you do, I think you're incorrect; however, where precisely the phrase model's regions lie is totally up for debate.</p>
<h4 class="question">OK, we've labeled all these things.  What now?</h4>
<p class="text">I don't know!  Whatever you want, I guess.  As we saw in <? sectionLinkShort('composition'); ?>, you should analyze music that you want to learn to emulate, but when you do that, you set your own path for how to do it.  What you want to learn is up to you.  I've done the labeling for this piece, but not much of the learning.  Rather, the labeling gives us a common language to use when we actually analyze music.  When I say that the first chord is a I, if you're well-versed in music theory, you understand what I mean because I know what I chords are and how they work.  I can then discuss Bach's use of I chords as the first chord in his chorales, which is actually interesting because many of his chorales <em>don't</em> start on the I.  If you want to learn about how Bach writes chorales, you can label a bunch of them (maybe all 389 if you're patient — you can probably do them all in a week if you get fast at it) and do some statistics.  The labeling on its own is not meaningful, but it's the language we use to talk about the actually meaningful things.</p>
<p class="text">In this chorale, though, one thing I find interesting is the use of secondary dominants in measure 6.  We have V/vi - vi - V/V - V, essentially, which forms a kind of sequence.  Kinda.  A <em>sequence</em> is when a set of chords is repeated at a different pitch level while maintaining its relationships.  For example, V/vi - vi - V/V - V forms a sequence: V/vi - vi simply repeats a step lower.  V/vi - vi have a V - i relationship, and V/V - V have the same V - I relationship.  The vi is minor while the V is major, but this is a <em>diatonic</em> sequence, where the main chords stay in the key.  A true diatonic sequence would be something like iii - vi - ii - V, but the iii is chromatically altered to V/vi and the ii is chromatically altered to V/V.  Don't worry too much if this doesn't make a lot of sense to you right now; it definitely will soon enough.  Now, I said that the chords form a sequence only kinda.  See, a sequence should be repeated exactly (other than the fact that it's transposed diatonically), but the chords here are actually V6/vi - vi - V42/V - V6, and the third chord in the sequence is actually two chords, V7/V - V42/V; there's some motion in the bass.  We can still hear the parallelism between the V6/vi - vi and the V42/V - V6, but it's not <em>quite</em> a sequence.</p>
<p class="text">Another interesting thing is a hidden cross-relation.  A <em>cross-relation</em> is when one voice has one version of a note and another voice has a different version of the note in close proximity.  This happens in measure 6, where the bass has an E# in beat 2 and the alto has an E natural in the second eighth note of beat 3.  They're not <em>technically</em> adjacent because Bach hid the cross-relation well, but it's there!  Beat 1 also features an E natural in the tenor that would get hidden by the D passing tone before the bass's E#, but this one doesn't count because the bass has the E natural as well.  Cross-relations generally stick out because the ear expects chromatic shifts to happen in the same voice, and in this case, it <em>does</em>, because the bass goes E - E#.  The fact that the tenor also has an E doesn't break the bass line.  By the way, the bass here, E - E# - F#, is an example of a chromatic line.  Chromatic lines pretty much always sound good.  Another one happens in the alto in bar 7, D# - E - E#.  The E# doesn't resolve up to F#, which is a missed opportunity, but Bach had his reasons.</p>
<p class="text">Yet another interesting thing also happens in measure 6: the first two beats have a V7 resolving to... V6/vi?  Is that a thing?  V7 generally resolves to I, right?  Well, that's the thing, it doesn't have to.  At the <em>cadence</em>, at the end of a phrase, it generally does, as we see in measure 4 leading into measure 5, but over the first two beats of measure 6, what we actually have is what's called <em>deceptive motion</em>, V - vi, just with a passing chord between them, the V6/vi.  If you pretend that the V6/vi chord doesn't exist, what we have is the soprano going B - A with an escape tone C# (we'll talk about those later), the alto going G# - F#, the tenor going E - C# with a passing tone D, and the bass going E - F# with a chromatic passing tone E#.  All of the voice leading is smooth.  But the dissonances resolve a bit irregularly: the D, a seventh above the bass, resolves down to C# as it should, but the D and G# form an augmented fourth that <em>doesn't</em> resolve with both notes expanding.  This brings up a good point that we'll see several times as we continue with analyses: we will learn "rules" about how to do "proper" voice leading, but these rules are meant to be broken!  The rules are like "don't do X... unless you feel like doing it".</p>
<h4 class="question">What's the value of a rule that's optional?  Isn't it better to just not have the rule?</h4>
<p class="text">The value is that you should understand the difference between following it and not following it so that you can choose what to do appropriately.  When we learn about voice leading, we'll see that Bach breaks the rules <em>all the fucking time</em>.  So why have rules?  Because breaking the rules is <em>interesting</em>, and sometimes you want to write something boring in the background so that the stuff you <em>want</em> to show off can have the spotlight.  These chorales may be fairly boring to us (...or not), but to people who grew up with these melodies in Bach's churches, his reharmonizations are a nice little twist from what they know.  The moving lines in the tenor and alto give something for the ear to hang on to; the chromatic bass lines provide a little bit of surprise (you don't hear the E# until measure 6, and since you were expecting a different chord after the V7 anyway, it's even more startling), etc.  Some rules, Bach refuses to break.  You won't catch him writing parallel fifths (with some exceptions that we'll talk about that don't count as breaking the rule).  On the other hand, Mozart is happy to write parallel fifths when it suits him.  We shouldn't think of them as rules so much as style guides.</p>
<p class="text">Finally, I just want to make a few notes about what we're doing here.  Functional harmonic analysis only applies to music that features functional harmony.</p>
<h4 class="question">No duh.</h4>
<p class="text">This is a serious point, though.  Harmony doesn't work according to Roman numerals.  <em>Functional</em> harmony works according to Roman numerals.  <em>Tonal</em> functional harmony works according to Roman numerals.  There's plenty of music out there where a Roman numeral labeling won't do much good because the Roman numerals simply don't describe the music's harmonies.  There are other techniques we can use to analyze such music, but the present chapter focuses on the music that <em>can</em> be analyzed with Roman numerals.</p>
<p class="text">Also, we're going to analyze a bunch of Bach chorales as well as other music, but the focus will be on more Common Practice-y stuff.  We haven't done a whole lot of Common Practice so far because, honestly, the music isn't all that interesting and I'm assuming that you're probably more interested in pop music or EDM (and probably not Brazilian popular music or Jewish liturgical music, but that's what you're gonna get so shut up and take it), but here, we have to do Common Practice for one big reason: other genres' harmonies aren't interesting enough to <em>analyze</em>.  Just look back at the chorale.  Each beat gets its own chord, sometimes in inversion; there's no four-chord loop or anything like that.  There are passing tones and neighbor tones; there are passing chords (like the V6/vi in measure 6) and neighbor chords (like the V6 in measure 1); there's a small modulation to D in measures 1 and 2 and a small modulation to E in measures 6 and 7.  There are four moving voices.  Sure, it may be boring to <em>listen</em> to Bach chorales, and it's probably also boring to sing them — most of them are actually part of larger works that are far more exciting — but they actually give us <em>stuff</em> to analyze.  Your general pop song goes vi - IV - I - V, repeated ad infinitum, and while we shouldn't make the mistake of assuming that pieces of music are bad because their harmony is simple, if we want to learn to do harmonic analyses, we need <em>something</em> substantial to analyze!  The techniques we're covering here are certainly applicable to pop and EDM as well, though.  We'll definitely look at stuff that's not Bach chorales, because most music doesn't tell us its harmonies in such a neatly packaged form, but we'll mostly stick with music that has enough interesting things to analyze that we'll learn something <em>about analysis</em>.</p>
<p class="text">Because the goal of analysis is to learn something about the piece of music, but <em>our</em> goal is to learn how to analyze in general!  So let's get started with analyzing harmonies by first learning what <em>not</em> to analyze...</p>

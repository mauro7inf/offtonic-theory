<p class="text">When we encounter music in real life to do a harmonic analysis, there's a <em>bit</em> of a snag.  Let's analyze the harmony in the following excerpt, the exposition from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_p8AgDp7SI">Contrapunctus VIII</a> (played in this video by a woodwind trio but there are no instruments specified in the original) from Bach's Art of Fugue:</p>

<p class="text">Can you write in the Roman numerals?</p>
<h4 class="question">No.  I cannot.  Where are the, like, chords?</h4>
<p class="text">Well, hey, that's what we're going to talk about in this section!</p>

<h3 class="subsection-title" id="2D">9.7.1 Two-Dimensional Sonorities</h3>

<p class="text">When we talk about chords, we're generally referring to many notes sounding at the same time.  A lot of the time, this makes sense, because some instrument is actually playing many notes at the same time, or an ensemble is collectively playing many notes at the same time.  But we've already seen, for example in <? sectionLinkShort('analysis nonharmonic'); ?>, that the notes happening at any given time aren't necessarily the harmony: there may be a suspension or passing tone, just as an example, or a pedal tone, or what have you, and it's not so simple to figure out what's in the chord and what isn't.  We need to think not only vertically — many notes at the same time are written vertically on the staff — but also horizontally, as melody.  The trivial example of horizontal thinking is Bach's Prelude 1 in C major from the Well-Tempered Clavier Book I, which we analyzed in <? exampleLink('Prelude 1 Book I'); ?>.  In that prelude, each chord was a five-note arpeggio, and we <em>interpreted</em> each arpeggio as a chord, but technically speaking there were never more than three notes being held at any time (the two lowest notes of each harmony were held, but the upper three were not).  There's a good reason for that, I think: Bach wrote the Well-Tempered Clavier to be played on a harpsichord, and harpsichords have fairly rough and bright attacks when you first play a note, so if you play many notes at once, you don't really get their sounds to combine harmonically very well, unlike with voices or various other instruments.  The situation is different on the piano, but there, Beethoven in his Moonlight Sonata, of which we analyzed the first movement in <? exampleLink('Moonlight I'); ?>, still opted for arpeggios for stylistic reasons, using the dark and resonant low tones of the piano as a harmonic bass line, something the harpsichord is not built to do.</p>
<p class="text">But Contrapunctus VIII is not a harpsichord piece (not that this should stop people from playing it on a harpsichord if they so choose!).  Bach didn't specify the instrumentation of the Art of Fugue, leaving the pieces as more abstract, and when I was in the MIT Wind Ensemble, our assistant director (renowned tubist Ken Amis) arranged the Art of Fugue for the ensemble.  His arrangement of Contrapunctus VIII, which is a triple fugue (it has three subjects, of which <? exampleLink('Contrapunctus VIII Exposition') ?> is only the first), features the keyboard percussion section in its exposition, and I personally think it sounds really cool.  Keyboard percussion is known for having very little sustain and very harsh attacks, so we don't hear much in the way of simultaneous pitches sounding.  Most of the harmony really has to be horizontal.</p>
<h4 class="question">But how do you assign chords to melodies?</h4>
<p class="text">It's tricky, but there <em>is</em> a method.  But first, we need to establish what we're actually trying to do.</p>
<p class="text">We have a piece of music.  It has harmony, in a sense, but it doesn't have explicit chords (for the most part).  Our goal is to figure out what the harmony <em>is</em>.  Later on, we'll be figuring out how to compose a harmony for a melody, but right now, the goal is to determine what it actually is right now.  It's often ambiguous, but it's also often not ambiguous at all, so for now, let's accept the ambiguity when it comes up.  We just want to get the <em>right</em> answer, if it exists.</p>
<h4 class="question">The <em>right</em> answer?  I thought music didn't have right answers.  Rule 0 of analysis, right?</h4>
<p class="text">OK, sure.  If you can justify it, we can consider it a right answer.  But my point is that if the composer was clear about a particular harmony, it's beyond our scope (right now) to recontextualize that harmony in some other way to create new music, something called <em>reharmonization</em>.  We'll get to that!</p>
<p class="text">Now, to figure out the chords, you basically try to assign a triad to whatever's there.  If you have a vertical sonority, those notes are likely all notes in the triad.  If you have melodic skips or extreme points in a melody, those notes are likely in the triad.  If you have non-harmonic tones — you need to watch out for those — their resolutions are likely in the triad.  If they don't all fit in a triad, you might be looking at a more complex chord, but at least in Western tonal music, the triad is your first guess.  The triad is done when the notes change to a new chord.  When this happens exactly may be up for debate, but it's useful to recognize the <em>harmonic rhythm</em> of the piece — that's how often the harmony changes.  In pop music, the chord often changes on the downbeat of every bar, while in a Bach chorale, there's usually a chord per beat.</p>
<p class="text">Every note can be in three diatonic triads in major, since it can be the root, third, or fifth of any of them.  The story gets more complicated as you venture out of the scale; even the minor mode, with its variations of the 6th and 7th degrees, adds more possibilities, as you can see below:</p>

<? createExample('chord possibilities'); ?>

<p class="text">The chords for each note are ordered roughly from most to least common in terms of harmonic implications of a melody.  I'm treating V, V7, and viio harmonies as equivalent here, which is why there are only two chords available for the D and the B in major, but notice how, in minor, we also have the bVII and v chords along with the V7 equivalents, so there are more options.</p>
<h4 class="question">What about chords like the bIII+ or the IV or ii or vio in minor, which use the raised 6th and 7th?</h4>
<p class="text">Good question.  Those chords are generally not implied by a melody because they're too weird.  If they come up, they'll be obvious enough that you won't be able to interpret them as something else (like, for example, if you actually just get the entire chord as a block).</p>
<p class="text">There's also a preference for the primary chords of the mode (I or i, V, IV or iv, in that order), with the tonic as the most prominent.  If you're in major and you hear a 1, a 3, or a 5, your first interpretation should be a I chord.  In particular, the I chord is more common under the 5 of the scale than the V chord.  On the other hand, a 2 would be more likely to be a V than a ii, since it's so close to the tonic; the ii chord is a little too complex to be implied very simply.  The iii is quite uncommon, so it's the last choice on a 3, 5, or 7.  The vi is kind of like a second tonal center, so since you're more likely to hear a melody as <em>not</em> modulating if you can help it, it's a later choice than, say, IV.  IV is a secondary point of stability in major, so the 4 generally implies the IV, but depending on context it could be a ii or V (the latter if it resolves down to the 3).  The V happens mainly with the 2 and 7, as well as 5 and 4 sometimes.</p>
<p class="text">We can summarize the major part of the example with just primary chords: 1 is I, 2 is V, 3 is I, 4 is IV or V, 5 is I or V, 6 is IV, 7 is V.  Anything else would be less ordinary.</p>
<p class="text">Minor plays out mostly the same, with the same primary chord summary.  However, we get a nice bonus with the 7, because while the b7 appears in three different chords, the 7 appears in just one (well, three, but they're equivalent).  On the other hand, we also need to consider the minor v and the bVII chords as possibilities.</p>
<h4 class="question">So how do we actually pick one?</h4>
<p class="text">You try to figure out which notes contribute to the harmony and use the chart as a kind of priority guide.  I'd show you with the Contrapunctus VIII exposition, but that's way too chromatic for us to start with, so let's look at the most basic example from the Art of Fugue, the exposition from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coh5g-Fkalo">Contrapunctus I</a> (performed by singers in the video, woodwinds in the example):</p>

<? createExample('Contrapunctus I Exposition'); ?>

<h4 class="question">What's all this entrance stuff?</h4>
<p class="text">I did a little bit of formal analysis for you just to help us understand the structure of a fugue, of which this is a <em>very</em> by-the-book example.  A <em>fugue</em>, as we've seen before, is a piece for n voices (n = 4 in this example) where the voices are contrapuntally independent and imitative, and in particular there is a melodic segment called a <em>subject</em> that is played by the different voices, generally at different times.  A fugue traditionally begins with an <em>exposition</em>, where each voice enters with the subject in turn.  We've actually covered this particular fugue subject before, in <? exampleLink('Contrapunctus I subject'); ?>.  The exposition begins with a single voice playing the subject, and when that's done, another voice enters a fifth up.  Why a fifth?  It's inherited from a Renaissance concept we call <em>collateral ranges</em>: if one voice is in an authentic mode, an adjacent voice will typically be in the plagal mode, and vice-versa.  Here, the alto is in authentic D minor, so the tenor and soprano are in plagal D minor, and the bass, adjacent to the tenor, is in authentic D minor with the alto.  These voices actually have much wider ranges, but when it comes to the subject itself, the subject generally spans the D - A pentachord, while the answer — the subject that has been transposed up a fifth — spans the A - D tetrachord — even though it actually dips into A minor for a while (we'll see how that works in a bit).  In the exposition of a standard fugue like this one, a subject is answered with an answer.  With the subject in the alto, the answer has the opposite type of mode, so it must be in the soprano (like here) or tenor, but not the bass.  If the subject enters in the soprano, on the other hand, the answer can be in the alto or bass, but not the tenor.  In a four-voice fugue like this one, the other two entrances are usually also in a subject-answer relationship, but if you look back at Contrapunctus VIII in <? exampleLink('Contrapunctus VIII Exposition'); ?>, which has only three voices, you'll see that the soprano entering third is actually a full octave above the alto entrance instead of a fifth.  By the way, if the answer is transposed up a fifth <em>exactly</em> instead of just switching scale fragments, the answer is called a <em>real answer</em> instead of a tonal answer.</p>
<p class="text">The <em>countersubject</em> is what the first voice plays during the second voice's answer, and generally the second voice plays it during the third voice's entrance, etc., and it serves as a second source of motivic ideas.  In this fugue, it only plays during the second and fourth entrances.</p>
<p class="text">After all the voices have played their subjects or answers, the main body of the fugue begins.  This part is very free-form, full of entrances of the subject in different voices, different keys, different patterns, etc., but sometimes there's a sequential section that does not contain the subject directly (but may be based on it thematically) called an <em>episode</em>.  This happens in measures 17-22.  In 17-20, the soprano and tenor have overlapping rhythmic patterns in a sequence while the bass has a different pattern, also in a sequence.  This 2+1 arrangement is quite common in Bach's fugues.  In 21-22, the tenor is now trading rhythms with the bass in a descending sequence, while the soprano just fills in.  At 23, the alto enters again with the subject, ending the episode, but we're not going to analyze the rest of the fugue for now.</p>
<p class="text">So.  We're here for harmonic analysis, right?  Let's do some of that.  We're going bit by bit:</p>

<? createExample('Contrapunctus I Exposition analysis 1'); ?>

<p class="text">I've tried to explain most of my analysis decisions right on the music to make it easier.  Here in this first melody, we know we're in D minor, basically for the same reason that we know the first chord: the first note is D, which suggests D minor or D major, and the next three notes outline a D minor triad.  Absent any other stimuli, that's as solid a D minor chord as we're going to get.  The next note, at measure 3, is the leading tone.  One might ask whether it's non-harmonic, but since it's a half note on the downbeat, which is a very strong metrical position, and we just had two straight measures of D minor with no notes from outside the chord, this first C# strikes me at least as a change in harmony, and that means a V chord.  V7?  viio?  Doesn't make a difference here.  It's a dominant harmony; that's all we can say.  We could say that the D in measure 3 represents a change back to i and that the E is a passing tone, or perhaps the E could be back to the V, but keeping the harmonic rhythm in mind, so far we're at one chord every two bars.  The D is metrically less strong than the C#, but since the arrival at 4 is on an F, it doesn't make sense to hear the D as the same i chord that measure 4 would have.  The E is even weaker, metrically, to get its own chord.  Later on we'll see the harmonic rhythm speed up, but for now, it doesn't make sense to analyze more than one chord in measure 3.</p>
<p class="text">Measure 4 is when it gets a bit trickier.  Bach gets quite elaborate with his non-harmonic tones when he wants to, so you could hear the whole of measure 4 as a V7 chord, with the F as a non-harmonic tone (or a V7b13, with the F being the b13).  The F resolves down to the E, you see, but that resolution is delayed until the last eighth note of the measure.</p>
<h4 class="question">That's a little silly.</h4>
<p class="text">Yes, it is a little silly... except that Bach does it in the ending of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApOc95USo4E">Contrapunctus II</a> (the violin arrival at 2:40, here played by the famous Kronos Quartet), which is another fugue on the same subject, just with a dotted eighth sixteenth rhythm instead of straight eighths.  So if you know the rest of the Art of Fugue, you might hear it this way, but if you're hearing this piece on its own, for the first time, it's much safer to assume that the F is the consonant note.</p>
<h4 class="question">So you got three chords out of four bars of melody?</h4>
<p class="text">Yeah!  An interesting thing about the Art of Fugue is that, if you listen to the whole thing, you'll hear this melody dozens of times (hm... I wonder how many times, exactly, but I'm not going to count them), and it'll be harmonized in dozens of different ways, sped up (diminution), slowed down (augmentation), etc.  I mean, it'll be harmonized differently eight bars later at the bass entrance.  But when you have just the melody, on its own, what we're tying to do is identify the harmonies that are <em>present</em>, not the harmonies we might compose around this melody.  But we only get these four bars to think about, because the soprano comes in the next bar:</p>

<? createExample('Contrapunctus I Exposition analysis 2'); ?>

<p class="text">With one voice, you can basically just say that something is ambiguous and move on.  With two voices, we have room for more intricacy while still being very ambiguous at times.  Two voices can't make complete chords, so we'll have to look at what's outlined.  In measure 5, we start with a D in the alto and an A in the soprano; these are metrically strong and, well, it's the tonic chord, Dm.  The alto plays a little scale that maintains that i chord.</p>
<h4 class="question">Why do we care about the i6 in measure 5 but we didn't call the chord with the C# a V6?</h4>
<p class="text">Sometimes there just isn't enough information to determine inversions, and sometimes there is.  In measure 7 in the alto, for example, the part goes B E, but which of these is the "real" bass note?  Things are slow enough at measure 5 that I think we can justify saying that the second half is a i6, but let's keep this in mind because it's debatable.</p>
<p class="text">In measure 6, we have some more uncertainty.  The melody in the countersubject (in the alto) heavily tonicizes the A, and in general, when a note is emphasized like that, is the root of the chord.  But then there's that F.  The A and C on their own, if we look at the chart, would suggest a bIII before a v, so that F is tempting.  However, the next bar has a G# in the soprano and B E in the alto, a very clear E major chord.</p>
<h4 class="question">E major?  That's not diatonic at all!</h4>
<p class="text">Indeed it is not!  But the chord is clear.  The chart of most likely diatonic chords is only when there's uncertainty, and with this E major chord, there isn't any.  So the downbeat of 6 is a v, which we treat as our pivot chord for a modulation to A minor.  When the F is introduced, it's a big leap and then the note is held for a quarter note and a half, which suggests that the F is harmonic.  The big note changes are happening on beats 1 and 3 at this point, so even though the F shows up a beat late, the chord at beat 3 is the F major (the A B C A figure in the alto emphasizes the A enough that I consider it the bass of the F major chord).</p>
<p class="text">Measure 7 clearly starts off with a V chord, and the F, which is the b9, contributes to its macroharmony.  It's debatable whether beat 3 represents a change in harmony.  I don't think so, but I can see an argument for the E to be a suspension.</p>
<h4 class="question">Don't suspensions resolve down?  Do you mean a retardation?</h4>
<p class="text">...Right.  Whoops.  Yes, a retardation.  I was getting confused with measure 8.  So the chord there would be made by F and A, which I think is still an F major chord even though D minor, which is iv, is higher on the chart than F major, bVI.  In any case, I think that's more of a passing sonority, since beat 4 is pretty clearly a V again (because we remember the G# from two beats earlier).</p>
<p class="text">Measure 8 has something interesting going on.  The downbeat is pretty standard; we had a V and now we have the C and E, which are the b3 and 5 of the i chord.  The only triads with both notes are the tonic A minor, which is the most natural choice, the bIII C major, which would involve the G# in the previous measure changing to G, which is not obvious, and C augmented, the bIII+, which would defeat the resolution of the V.  It's pretty easy to see that it should be a i.  I'm not calling it a i64 because it's not functioning like a second-inversion chord.  But then, look at the alto: E F# G.  What's that F# doing there?  It's clearly a leading tone to the G, and with the E there, this is a 6 7 1 in G.  The arrival is therefore heavily implied to be a G chord (note that in Renaissance music it was somewhat common for that to not be the case, but it sounds strange to our ears now).  But that C is a fourth above the G, and fourths, as we hopefully remember, are dissonant intervals when above the bass.  So, we hear the C as a suspension that simply takes a while to resolve to the Bb, making this a G minor chord.  G minor doesn't make sense in the context of A minor, but it does make sense in the context of D minor, which is where we go in the next measure.</p>
<h4 class="question">That was fairly involved for the harmonic analysis of a single measure.  Can't we just say that it's C major, which fits the E, the G, and the C?  Or just say that it's ambiguous and leave it at that?</h4>
<p class="text">I don't think C major is justified here, but I would be OK with calling it ambiguous... if it were ambiguous.  The E F# G tonicizes G too clearly for that.  Let's continue, though, to the bass entrance, where our job becomes much easier:</p>

<? createExample('Contrapunctus I Exposition analysis 3'); ?>

<p class="text">With three voices, the harmony can get more intricate, since it doesn't need to be merely implied as much.  We'll see that it still is.  At measure 9, the bass enters on a D, and the other voices have a G and an A that goes down to D.  If you're thinking only vertically, D G A or D G D is some sort of sus chord, but the G resolves to F in the next beat, making this a clear D minor.  The A isn't sounding anymore, but since it was struck at the downbeat (as the resolution of the soprano figure in the previous bar), it's still a chord tone.  This is that 2-dimensional thinking we're talking about; all of the notes in the first two beats of the bar contribute to the harmony, except the ones we decide are non-harmonic.  In beat 3, it may appear that nothing has changed, with the E in the alto as a passing tone, but Bach doesn't present all of the chord tones at the same time, does he?  The D in the soprano becomes a suspension that resolves down to C#, giving us a complete V chord on beat 4.  Can't get clearer than that!</p>
<h4 class="question">So why is the V under beat 3?  Shouldn't it be under beat 4?</h4>
<p class="text">No, because the harmonic rhythm is still half notes thanks to the bass.  We do consider everything together when we talk about harmonic rhythm, but the concept is a bit nebulous, and strong half notes in the bass do a good job of establishing it.</p>
<p class="text">The intricacy and ambiguity get ratcheted up in measure 10 thanks to a kind of sequential pattern in the soprano.  Look at the rhythms in the soprano: in measure 9, we get a higher eighth note, A, followed by a low eighth note, the D, and a higher longer note, the high D.  In measure 10 we get the same thing: high D, low A, high C, then high C (tied from before), low A, high Bb, then Bb (tied), low E, high A.  We can see the descending contour of the D in measure 9, the C and Bb in measure 10, and the A in measure 11.  At the same time, the alto in measures 10 and 11 has a dotted quarter eighth rhythm that's offset from the soprano rhythm, filling its gaps and vice-versa.  Soprano gets two eighths, alto gets two eighths, then soprano again, alto again, soprano again, alto again.  With all this happening, the harmony becomes secondary.  The problem is that I hear pretty much the entire soprano at measure 10 as non-harmonic.  Luckily, we can analyze this contrapuntally instead (which is how Bach almost certainly thought of it himself).</p>
<p class="text">The C on beat 2 is a minor 7th, a dissonance, against the D in the alto.  The D goes up to E on the eighth note, but then it continues to F, while the bass goes from F to D, making the D E F alto line just a voice exchange with the bass that has a passing tone.  The C is still dissonant against the bass D at beat 3.  It then resolves to Bb, which is consonant, but first it hits the A, which is a chord tone of the existing D minor infrastructure, so is the Bb a chord tone or not?  Is the C a chord tone or not?  In the spirit of evolving harmonies, I think we can say that the harmony at beat 4 is a Bb major chord, but we can't really say when that chord started; there's no clear harmonic rhythm in this measure, since the bass half notes do not imply a chord change.  More than that, the actual target chord isn't a Bb major but a G minor.  i7 normally resolves to iv, not bVI6.  So I think this is another case of Bach's harmonies not happening all at the same time.</p>
<p class="text">When the F in the alto finally does reach G at measure 11, the bass has denied that expected G minor chord.  The leading tone in minor always (well... virtually always) represents some kind of V chord.  Here, it's in the bass, so it's a V65.  This could be a viio7, since in the first beat of measure 11 we have C# in the bass, G in the alto, and Bb and E in the soprano, but due to the bass half notes dictating a harmonic rhythm, I'm hearing the Bb as a suspension to the A, making the chord an A7b9 in first inversion.  I'm not going to bother notating the 9th, so it's just V65 for me.  We get a little dissonance in beats 3 and 4 with the scale in the alto, but the bass quarter notes again dictate a harmonic rhythm and it's not difficult to figure out what's what.  Beat 3 has all of the notes of a Dm chord and beat 4 has all the notes of a V64 (a great example of a passing 64, by the way).</p>
<p class="text">Measure 12 gets confusing again.  Remember back in measure 4 when we weren't entirely sure of what harmonies to assign to that measure of melody?  Looks like Bach simply didn't imply a harmony there, because most of the time that piece of melody shows up, Bach has a different idea, and it's almost always dissonant or at least wildly reinterpreted.  Here, we get the fourths again.  The alto goes D G, a fourth, and the G plays against a C such that you can't avoid the C major.  In the first beat, you get the strong F in the bass.  The alto has a D at the end of a dissonant scale, so that D is a chord tone too.  The soprano is still holding an A.  That's a clear i6 chord.  But the soprano quickly goes to a C, a dissonance against the D, and that C B C pattern sounds like a cadence on C (the 1 7 1 pattern), and the alto goes to G, a fourth below the C, while the bass is still on... F!  Strange!  On beat 3, then, the G and C pretty much have to imply a C major chord in first inversion (because the fourth on its own is dissonant), except that by the time the E shows up in the last eighth note, the alto has already moved down to C.  It's evolving harmonies, man!</p>

<? createExample('Contrapunctus I Exposition analysis 4'); ?>

<p class="text">With the tenor entrance, we now have all four voices in play (though the alto's about to leave for the episode).  The tenor plays the tonal answer to the bass's subject in the previous four bars, while the bass plays the countersubject — the same thing the alto played under the soprano entrance.  The only differences (besides both parts having shifted down an octave) are: the scale at measure 5 is gone in measure 13, and the quarter notes at measure 8 are now an eighth note pattern in thirds at measure 16.  Some of the analysis, then, will be familiar, except that now we have the soprano and alto doing other stuff too, recontextualizing what we'd heard earlier.</p>
<p class="text">At 13, the soprano and alto continue the eighth note interplay from 10-11, but starting on a C in the soprano.  The C is clearly important, so the whole chord at the downbeat of 13 is a i7.  Nothing changes at beat 3, except that now the C is resolving, which it finally does at beat 4 to the B natural.  B natural is not in the key of D minor, so it suggests a modulation into A minor, and now the bVII6 of measure 12 makes a bit more sense, doesn't it?  It's actually a bIII6 in A minor, going to iv7 at 13.  bVII to i is not something that happens in Common Practice music, but bIII to iv is.  However, I don't really hear the key as having changed until the B natural comes in, which is why I marked the modulation where I did.  Again, chalk it up to Bach evolving his harmonies instead of being sudden.  These slowly changing harmonies are part of how he keeps the lines independent.  You could try to imagine the harmonies implied by each line individually and see where they line up.  I won't, but you can.</p>
<p class="text">On beat 4 of measure 13, we get the B natural, which sounds like an anticipation because it isn't part of the Dm7 chord we're on.  D F B makes a Bdim chord, iio in A minor, but that's not clearly the important sonority since it doesn't happen on the half note that seems to be the established harmonic rhythm.  But then the alto leaps down to a G#.  Leaps are not generally dissonant in Common Practice music unless they're appoggiaturas or something like that, which the G# isn't (it's the same high-low-high pattern we've seen elsewhere, including the downbeat of 13 in the soprano).  Now the F and G# both feel like chord tones, and the half note D in the tenor is clearly a chord tone, so this contextualizes the B.  Our chord tones are now D G# F B, which is a viio43 in A minor.</p>
<p class="text">At 14 we get the C and E in the tenor and alto, which imply A minor, and the resolving soprano and entering bass confirm.  The harmony doesn't change on beat 3, again, so now we've established a pattern of harmony changing on weak beats.  Beat 4, the bass has an F, which is not part of the A minor harmony, and the alto moves to D at the same time.  The combination of the bass leap and the alto motion make the D sound like a chord tone, giving us a clear D minor sonority (iv6 in A minor).  You <em>could</em> hear the C in the alto as a change to F major (bVI), or even as a dissonant chord tone (iv65), but it doesn't resolve like one, so we're better off thinking of it as merely a lower neighbor to the D.</p>
<p class="text">Measure 15. the first two beats are another of those evolving situations.  The first beat has all the notes of a viio65 and the second beat has all the notes of a V7.  I wouldn't actually say that the harmony has changed from beat 1 to beat 2, but the entrance of the E does take the chord from being a rootless dominant to being a rooted one.  This is partly why, when it comes to implied harmony, I consider the V, V7, and viio equivalent, and, by extension, stuff like the viio7 (and all their inversions).  Beat 3 is a sort of resolution of the V7, but it's not really resolved yet because it's a i64: the E, the fifth, is firmly in the bass, and we've still got a measure and a half of subject to go through before the phrase can properly be resolved.</p>
<p class="text">What happens on beat 4 is interesting, though: the alto's gone.  Bye alto.  We're left with E to D in the bass, B in the tenor, D in the soprano.  Third-less E7 chord, right?  Not so fast: the downbeat of 16 is clearly some sort of C major (C7, actually).  E7 - C7 involves two chromatic shifts (G# to G and B to Bb), not to mention that all the voices seem to be doing a cadence in C major.  The notes B and D <em>do</em> imply a dominant equivalent in C major, don't they?  So the E is just an accented passing tone for our viio6 in C major (viio6/bIII in A minor).</p>
<p class="text">The C major itself at the downbeat of 16 ends up with a Bb on the second eighth note, so that would make it a secondary dominant to F major... right?  But Bach says NO to your foolish ways.  F?  Fuck that noise.  How's about F <em>sharp</em>, eh?  The bass does a 6 7 1 to G again, just like eight measures earlier, and the only difference (besides the eighth note pattern) is the addition of the third voice in the soprano.  The F# is now no longer a passing tone because the soprano harmonizes it; beat 2 has an F#dim chord.  C7 in G minor is actually <em>not</em> a secondary dominant but a IVdom7 chord, which goes to V (well, viio) then i, following the melodic minor scale.  And this is exactly what happens, as beats 3 and 4 have the parallel sixths resolving to the last eighth note implying a Gm sonority, which is the i in G minor.  We don't stay in G minor, though; we just briefly tonicized it.  Perhaps instead of modulating to G minor and writing g: IV6(b5), I should have modulated to D minor and written d: IV6(b5)/iv, viio/iv, iv.  I figured that was too cumbersome, so I just modulated to G minor instead.  That's not a consequential choice.  Doesn't really matter.</p>

<p class="text">We now take a quick six-measure break from the fugue subject, which comes in again in the alto at 23 but we're not analyzing that far, and do some fun patterns in what's called an <em>episode</em>.  This episode is not a strict sequence, because of course Bach doesn't do anything that easy.  No.  But it <em>is</em> sequential.  The soprano and tenor have basically the same pattern but off by two beats.  Look at this.  Downbeat of 17, tenor has a half note A.  Two beats later, soprano has a half note Bb.  Two beats after that, tenor has a half note C.  Two beats later, soprano half note D.  Two beats later, tenor half note E.  Two beats later, soprano half note F.  Two beats later, tenor half note G.  Two beats later, the pattern breaks because the A in the soprano is only a quarter note and an octave lower.  But, dude, that's the entire D minor scale from A to A in a very clear pattern!  The bass also has a two-beat pattern that just keeps going up, but the chromaticism is irregular, possibly to accommodate the Bb and B natural at 19-20.  With sequences, the harmonic rhythm often speeds up, and this happens here, where we get one chord per quarter note.</p>
<p class="text">At 17, we have a D and A in the bass and tenor, with an obviously dissonant suspended G in the soprano.  That G, as a decorated suspension, resolves to F by first going to E, the lower neighbor of the F, though you can also hear the G as resolving to F and the E as resolving to D.  Either way, the chord is obviously D minor, and we're back home.  At beat 3, the situation is D in the bass, which is consonant with the Bb in the soprano.  As an arrival, the Bb is clearly a chord tone, so the A in the tenor, which is dissonant with the Bb, is in need of resolution.  Remember that the Bb is the b6 of D minor, and the first implication for a b6 in the chart is a iv chord, and when the A in the tenor resolves — the F doesn't count because suspensions resolve by step, so the resolution is the G — we have our complete iv64 chord, finally... except no we don't, because the bass has an E.  But the E resolves down to the D.  Call it a neighbor tone, call it an anticipation of the E in the next bar.  Or...</p>
<h4 class="question">Or?</h4>
<p class="text">E G Bb makes a iio chord.  That's pretty legit, right?</p>
<h4 class="question">Yeah, I guess.  WHy are you asking me?</h4>
<p class="text">From looking at measure 17, the reading of iio is a bit silly; of course the E is non-harmonic.  But from looking at measures 18-20, that iio interpretation gets more and more attractive.  And that iv64 that was so obvious?  The A and F in the tenor aren't necessarily non-harmonic tones.  That's a BbM7 chord, a bVI65, in a diatonic fifth relationship with the iio.</p>
<h4 class="question">Now <em>that's</em> crazy.</h4>
<p class="text">But is it, though?  It's not.  I stand by my analysis of iv64 as the chord the listener actually hears, but part of the magic of Bach's writing is that, by the next bar, that chord was actually a bVI65.  Oh, and do you notice how the soprano is a minor ninth above the tenor?  You'd actually call this a 2-3 suspension, since the tenor makes a compound second with the soprano and resolves to a compound third, but minor ninths are very dissonant.  You may have read that the minor ninth is some sort of "last frontier" of musical freedom.  Bullshit.  Bach's the OG and he used them.  In the 1700's.  Damn, dawg.  (Also, the first two eighth notes in the soprano at measure 17, which I marked as non-harmonic tones, could actually be a hidden V7 chord, completing the pattern.  Bach, dude.)</p>
<p class="text">Measure 18 starts getting more straightforward.  Beat 2 is weak, so you might not want to think of the harmony as actually changing from beat 1 to beat 2: beat 1 could be an appoggiatura, the E resolving to the F in the bass and the Bb resolving to the A in the soprano.  But, appoggiatura or not, we still hear a distinct chord in beat 1 that is different from what's in beat 2.  Luckily, the voicings are clear as day: E C Bb G on beat 1 is a C7 chord, a V65/bIII, and beat 2 has F C A, an F major chord, bIII.  Beat 3, same story, clear D7 chord; beat 4, clear G chord.  The D7 is a V65/iv, but the G major chord is interesting, because we're ostensibly still in D minor, and the diatonic chord here is iv, not IV.  I chalk it up to Bach's rampant chromaticism (Baroque music is boring, my ass), but also, the B leaps up to the E, and it would be a tritone if it had been a Bb.  The B natural is a bit unexpected, but it also plays well with the chromatically raised notes in the bass.</p>
<p class="text">One thing I want to point out right here: the soprano and tenor are essentially trading leaps of a fourth, right?  A leap of a fourth up very strongly suggests a 5 - 1.  Measure 17 in the soprano actually goes from D to Bb, a minor sixth, and that does not strongly suggest that the Bb is the 1, hence the analysis of G minor.  But the tenor G to C, soprano A to D, tenor B to E, etc., those <em>do</em> strongly suggest 5 - 1.  That's the kind of horizontal thinking that I'm talking about when it comes to understanding implied harmonies.</p>
<p class="text">Measure 19 begins as before; beat 1 is obviously an E7 (V65/V) and beat 2 is obviously an Am (v).  This could be another modulation, since v chords don't usually show up in ascending progressions, but sequences break all the rules so it's OK, especially since we get a C# in the next beat.  But that next beat, beat 3, is different, because it isn't a dominant 7th chord.  We're now in the same position we were in back in measure 17.  Before you think that this is an ironic twist of fate or whatever, consider that the half notes in measure 17 go A Bb and here they go E F: they're the two semitones of the D minor scale.  Interestingly, though, here the tenor has a C# instead of a C, probably because we're in D minor and the C# is the standard note to use when going up to D.  Interpreting the E and C# as non-harmonic tones, which is legit but isn't the pattern, this is a Dm in second inversion, but if you count them as chord tones, it's a bIII+7 in first inversion!  Augmented 7th chords in Bach!  The reason this isn't outlandish is because it's the same pattern already established in the last six beats (or eight, or even ten).  Beat 4 is your standard bVI chord, nothing new there.</p>
<p class="text">Measure 20 continues the pattern; the first beat is clearly a G7 chord and the second beat is clearly C major.  bVII is a relatively rare chord in Common Practice, as I mentioned, but this is a sequence so it's perfectly fair game here.  The melodic pattern of the sequence breaks at beat 3, but the harmonies don't; beat 3 is obviously a V65 (it's got that C#, the leading tone) and beat 4 is obviously the tonic, fulfilling the pattern.  Unless the G# is a chord tone.  Then it's a viio7/v.  Honestly, I think it's kinda both.  I do <em>not</em> think that there is a meaningful change in harmony at the eighth note level here; the harmonic rhythm is still quarter notes.  But you do get an implied dominant to the A minor from the G#, even though that's not the primary harmony of beat 4.  You could say that the harmony is the i but the macroharmony implies the viio7/v.</p>
<p class="text">Measure 21 continues the descent of the soprano part.  Look at the contour from 20: high F at beat 1, E at beat 2, D at beat 4, and now, in measure 21, C at beat 2, Bb at beat 4, A at beat 1 of measure 22, G at beat 4, F in 23 when the suspension resolves (outside the excerpt).  Descending scales like this are a ratcheting <em>down</em> of tension, while ascending scales generally ratchet it up, so this is a denouement of sorts.  When we descend in minor, we use the lowered b7 and b6, so the v here at the downbeat of 21 makes perfect sense.  Beat 3 has a b3 in the soprano, which is a great indicator of a i chord.  I analyzed it as a i6 because of the momentary F in the bass, but I'm not entirely convinced that the F <em>or</em> the A serves as the bass of the chord.  Beat 4 is a straight-up G minor, or it would be if the D didn't go up to the E in the tenor.  If it were a passing tone, I might not analyze it as a chord tone, but it's kind of an escape tone here and it's a common tone with the V in the next chord anyway, so I think it makes sense to treat the E as a chord tone, making this a iiø65 instead of a iv.  Those two chords are roughly equivalent anyway.</p>
<p class="text">iiø65 (or iv) gives way to V43 at 22, at least of the E is interpreted as the bass.  I think it should be here, given how it resolves meaningfully up to F on beat 2, a standard i6.  Beat 3 has F and D in the bass, B in the tenor, and D in the soprano, making a Bdim chord.  This is not ordinarily diatonic to D minor, but the tenor is going B C# D, a 6 7 1 in D minor, so it gets harmonized with a Bdim, the vio (in first inversion here).  Beat 4 is interesting, because E and G would generally make an A7 chord of some sort in D minor.  Here, the B is still sounding, but only for an eighth note; notes held over like that don't generally carry weight.  But you <em>do</em> hear an Em chord, I think, which is the ii.  The real target is the viio6, but the sound of the ii chord is distinctive enough in minor that it's worth noting it in the analysis.  This viio6 resolves, as expected, to i at 23, and that's where our analysis ends.  I encourage you to continue the analysis; you can find the entire Art of Fugue on <a href="https://imslp.org/wiki/Die_Kunst_der_Fuge%2C_BWV_1080_(Bach%2C_Johann_Sebastian)">IMSLP</a>.</p>
<p class="text">We're ready now to take on the more chromatic Contrapunctus VIII.</p>
<h4 class="question">What about music that's, like, <em>not</em> a fugue?</h4>
<p class="text">That'll be next!  But we can't just leave you hanging on this fugue, right?</p>

<? createExample('Contrapunctus VIII Exposition analysis'); ?>

<p class="text">Let's quickly talk about structure first.  This is the exposition of a three-voice fugue, so there are only three entrances of the subject, which I'd argue actually ends at the downbeat of 5.  The subject begins in the alto, after which the bass enters down a fourth (equivalent of up a fifth), but this time, it's transposed exactly: it's a <em>real answer</em> rather than a tonal answer like we saw in Contrapunctus I.  The alto plays a countersubject during the bass entrance; when the soprano comes in on the untransposed subject at 11 (this time up an octave from the alto), the bass takes up the countersubject for a few bars.  I stopped the excerpt at measure 16 because that's a nice little cadence, but the piece goes on for actually quite a while; this is a long fugue (with three subjects, as I mentioned earlier, making it a <em>triple fugue</em>).</p>
<p class="text">So, the harmony, real and implied:</p>
<h4 class="question">Why are the V/V and ii/vi written below the other Roman numerals in measures 12 and 13?</h4>
<p class="text">Because it was looking too cramped all in the same line.  You know, practical considerations.  Same reason that Welsh doesn't have the letter K.</p>
<h4 class="question">Wait, what?</h4>
<p class="text"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_orthography">Yep</a>.  The printers didn't have enough K's so they just used C's instead and it stuck.</p>
<h4 class="question">Holy shit.</h4>
<p class="text">We're getting off-tonic.  Off-topic.  Typo.  Let's run over the analysis of Contrapunctus VIII, above.  This melody is tricky to analyze harmonically because of the chromaticism in measure 2.  What chords do these imply?  The C and F in measure 2 imply an F major chord, the bIII, and bIII tends to go to iv, so the B natural would appear to refer to that IV.  We don't have the situation of a raised 6th degree in melodic minor because that raised 6th goes up to the raised 7th, and instead we're going down chromatically to the b6.  If the B natural implies a IV chord, G major, then the G is still implied when the B natural changes to Bb, giving us IV - iv.  Measure 3 has A - D, a 5-1 in D minor, so the implied harmonic progression becomes i - bIII - IV - iv - i.  See anything wrong with that?</p>
<h4 class="question">No?</h4>
<p class="text">Good.  Beat 2 of measure 3 is a trill.  You hopefully remember what this means from <? sectionLinkShort('notation ornaments'); ?>: you rapidly alternate between the note given and the note above it, diatonically, which, in this case, is G alternating with A.  Baroque trills start on the upper note and usually do a little flourish at the end; this synthesized realization doesn't do that because I didn't feel like actually writing out the trill.  In either case, it's a G and an A.  You can think of it as just ornamentation of the G, but the G and A are both chord tones in the V7, which resolves nicely into the F at measure 4 that implies a i chord.  You could argue that the A G A at beat 2 is another V7 chord, but I don't think that's clearly implied at all.  The low D, of course, is a tonic chord.  Notice the lowest points of this entire line, by the way: D at measure 1, C, B, Bb at measure 2, A, G at measure 3, F at measure 4, D at measure 5.  It's almost the complete scale.</p>
<p class="text">Measure 5 gives us some interesting harmonic implications.  The C is not part of the D minor chord, so it's either non-harmonic or a chord tone, but which chord?  The B afterwards tells us: we're not in D minor anymore.  It's a bit unclear in the moment, but if we look ahead to the bass entrance at 6, where we've fully modulated into A minor, we see that we have to interpret the C in measure 5 as a v chord, which is the pivot in the modulation to A minor.</p>
<p class="text">In measure 6, it seems like we have another 5-1 in F, but the F resolves down to E, and that E is a fifth above a big entrance on the tonic (of A minor), so we know it's A minor, the i, and not an F major or something.  In measure 7, the alto recontextualizes the subject (which is what happens pretty much all the time in any fugue), but we do actually get similar chords as before.  There's something weird going on, though: over the F# we have a D, making it a D major chord (or a B minor chord, but that's unlikely).  Over the F natural, we get a C, making an F major chord, then a B, making... what?  The F and C is an example of the direct fifths Bach loves to write (it's amazing he doesn't do parallel fifths anywhere near as often; dude's like, fuck the theory police), but he actually treats it as a dissonance.  Yeah.  Bach's open fifths are dissonant.  It's like the world's gone upside-down!  The real important note here is the B, a tritone above the F, as the F and B open up to E and C, respectively.  F# and D, that's a D major.  F and B, that's a Bdim, which is equivalent to G7.  E and C, that's C major.  V/V - viio - I.  Except that we're in A minor, not C major!  We need two-dimensional thinking.  That E and C actually have an A in the bass too, on the second eighth note, making it an Am chord, not C major.  So the F and B are... viio42.</p>
<h4 class="question">I call bullshit.  I call bullshit on this whole chapter.  BULL.  SHIT.</h4>
<p class="text">Yeah, I know, it's missing the leading tone.  But we're in two-voice counterpoint.  We don't have enough notes to actually use all the chord tones.  The F and B are enough to resolve to E and C.  This sonority is clearly acting as a dominant, right?  And there's no E to make it a V chord, so it's a rootless dominant, which is a viio chord of some sort.  It's just... also missing the 7.</p>
<h4 class="question">Why not call it a Bdim, then, which is iio, instead of a rootless <em>rootless</em> chord?  viio is G#dim and there's no G#!</h4>
<p class="text">Because iio is a pre-dominant chord, and this is a dominant.  The harmony is <em>implied</em>, not explicit.  That's kind of the whole point of this section.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 8, 9, and 10 I leave as an exercise to the reader.  They're quite straightforward; there aren't even any non-harmonic tones!  Except the B at 10, I guess, but still.  The only thing I'll mention there is that the low A kind of outweighs the G in the next eighth note, so I don't think the harmony changes with the G, and i7 is a perfectly reasonable way to hear the harmony in this beat as a whole.  And I'll also mention that we're back in D minor in preparation for the soprano entrance.</p>
<p class="text">Measure 11 is also straightforward, and the notes are very explicit.  Notice how the alto has these 16th notes in thirds, which allow it to have two chord tones at once, kinda, in a <em>compound melody</em>.  Bach is the king of compound melodies.  The last chord is the secondary dominant to A minor, which leads to the A minor at measure 12 — a very clear root position A minor.  But, looking ahead, and you'd need to actually look ahead, we see that we're modulating to F major, the key of the bIII in D minor.  I put the pivot at this A minor chord because I feel that's a reasonable choice, but you can argue for the pivot being elsewhere.  The new tonality isn't established until we get a little cadence right there: the B - Bb - A is a #4 - 4 - 3 in F, and unlike in measure 7, we really <em>do</em> have a V/V - viio - I!  The countersubject in the bass is the same as the alto was in measure 7, but the new alto part at 12 recontextualizes it.</p>
<p class="text">Measure 13 is very straightforward, but I want to point out that the G trills with A, and the A is non-harmonic in the first eighth note (over the alto B and bass E, making an Em) and harmonic in the second eighth note (against the alto E and bass C#, making an A7).  You might think that Em is a strange chord in F, being the vii, and you'd be right: it's functioning as a ii in a ii - V - i in D minor at this point.</p>
<h4 class="question">Why is it a B natural?  Shouldn't it be Bb since we're in F, or Dm or something?</h4>
<p class="text">It's to avoid jumping up a tritone from Bb to E, and probably to add a little chromatic spice too.  Bach doesn't avoid all tritone leaps (see the <em>subject of this very fugue</em> where he goes from F down to B), but he does save them for when they will not cause an inner voice to sound disjointed.  Furthermore, the ii - V - i is a colorful D minor cadence that depends on the raised 6th, even though it's not going up to the raised 7th at all; it emphasizes D minor at the same time as Bach is trying to deemphasize it.  The cadence at 14 is an intermediate cadence to prepare the harmony for the real arrival in F major at 16.  Looking ahead at the harmony, at 14 we have a vi - ii - V — well, I64 instead of V, which goes somewhat deceptively to IV, but the bass has an extremely strong 4 - 5 - 1 to arrive at F.  That's a real cadence!</p>
<p class="text">Going back to measure 14, I called beat 3 a I64, but there's no root in this chord so it's not actually dissonant.  The root is implied, but the dissonance in a 64 chord comes from the 4 above the bass, which is the root, and that's not present here.  So the 64 isn't really acting that much like a 64 that needs resolution.  You may ask why it's an F major chord if there's no F, and that's because it makes more sense than calling it an Am chord, which is the iii.  The soprano and alto move in decorated parallel sixths: A and F to Bb and G to C and A, and filling an E between the C and A would be more surprising than the F we just heard a beat ago.  If the E were explicit, that would be another story, of course.  Measure 15 is very straightforward, as is the downbeat of 16, and there ends our analysis.</p>
<p class="text">I hope these two Bach fugues have given you an understanding of how to get a harmony from a polyphonic work.  Bach isn't the only composer who has written polyphonic music, of course, but he's the best.</p>
<h4 class="question">That is arguable.</h4>
<p class="text">How?  Who's better than Bach at counterpoint?</p>
<h4 class="question">There's...  OK, I see your point.</h4>
<p class="text">We looked at some counterpoint specifically because the harmonies aren't necessarily explicit even though there are multiple parts going on.  In more modern styles of music (and by Bach's time, fugues had been out of fashion for a century), all the harmony is explicit; it's right there.  But in a fugue, you have to tease it out; it's not quite at the surface.  It's a great introduction to implied harmony because <em>some</em> of it is explicit and some is not.  You have to look at the sonorities that happen together in different parts as well as how each melody incorporates different chord tones, and both contribute.  We're now heading into a less explicit area: single melodies.</p>

<h3 class="subsection-title" id="harmonizing">9.7.2 Harmonizing a Melody</h3>

<p class="text">As I said, we're now going to step away from Bach (far, far away) and look at melodies on their own.  Looking back at <? exampleLink('Contrapunctus I Exposition analysis 1'); ?> and <? exampleLink('Contrapunctus VIII Exposition analysis'); ?>, specifically the analyses of the first solo entrance of the subject in each fugue, we can see that when a single line is analyzed, the harmonies tend to be very simple.  Why?  Because we don't have enough information for anything more than that.  You can only squeeze so much harmony from single notes.  However, a very practical thing to do is to stick some harmony on a melody; this is a situation that comes up very often in composition and even just in general singing.  If you're singing with other people, you might want to harmonize (if you don't know the melody, harmonizing may actually be easier!).  If you're just writing music, well, you'll want to add chords to your melodies.  We've seen a few Bach chorales already in this chapter (<? exampleLink('chorale 1'); ?>, <? exampleLink('chorale 110'); ?>), and these chorales are also examples of harmonized melodies: Bach took existing 200-year-old hymns (well, 500-year-old hymns now, but by Bach's time they were only about 200) and created extensive and varied harmonic settings for those hymns.</p>
<p class="text">Harmonizing a melody can be an <em>extremely</em> open task.  Depending on your harmonic language, you can reasonably play <em>any</em> chord under <em>any</em> note or combination of notes.  But we're going to stick with the basics for now: we're going to write —</p>
<h4 class="question">Write?</h4>
<p class="text">That's what I said, write — a harmonic line to go along with a melody, but it's going to sound "<em>normal</em>".  We'll talk about how to make it sound weird later.  If you're harmonizing with other people, a "normal"-sounding harmony will likely match how other people are harmonizing.  Of course, "normal" is relative to the harmonic language, and, for the record, Bach's chorales are definitely <em>not</em> "normal"; they're inventive compositions designed in part to showcase his vast compositional talent.  Let me give you an example.  The melody below is Al Kol Eleh, by Naomi Shemer; you should play it or sing it yourself before we go on (I won't provide an audio link so as not to bias your harmonic considerations, but if you know Jewish/Israeli music you'll likely know this one already anyway):</p>

<? createExample('Al Kol Eleh melody'); ?>

<p class="text">The melody is very simple, but that simplicity only opens up more possibilities.  This is the first verse, which consists of two complete phrases (and is followed by a chorus that we're not harmonizing now); since the two phrases are identical, let's ignore the repeat.  What are the implied harmonies?  If we extract out the important notes, we get something that looks sort of like this:</p>

<? createExample('Al Kol Eleh melody reduction'); ?>

<p class="text">These are all of the structurally important notes; we get the extremes of the ranges as well as the notes emphasized by their rhythmic positions.  We can see that the downbeat is on 3 after a 1-2 pickup, so that's pretty obviously outlining a I chord.  We then get 3 - 2 - 1 in the important notes (in measure 1), and you could consider the 2 a passing sonority.  The implied harmony for the 3 and the 1 is a I chord, and I think the V in between them is not essential but I'm fine with it there.  We're only trying to figure out what the harmonic implications are right now, not actually compose a harmonization, so let's just say the V is optional.  In the bit of music in measure 2, it starts out the same, with the I chord, but it ends on the 2 of the scale.  This is structurally important.  2 can represent V or ii, but since it's an <em>arrival</em>, that suggests a ii rather than a V.  This is entirely debatable.  But the next phrase begins on the 7, so when the 2 appears at the downbeat of measure 3, the V implications are more salient.  The 2 stays as the held note for the entire measure until the phrase ends 7-1, which is V - I.</p>
<p class="text">This is a serviceable harmony.  We start out with T (tonic) function (the V at measure 1 serves only to elaborate the I, so it's not a structurally important chord); we proceed to the PD (pre-dominant) function on the ii; we then get to the D (dominant) at measure 3 and eventually resolve back to T (tonic) at the end.  T - PD - D - T, the general phrase model used in Western tonal music.  We get all this from the implied harmony of the melody; the melody contains this information, for the most part (if you argue that the ii should really be a V, we have the simplified T - D - T model, which is also perfectly normal in Western tonal music).  But it's not <em>interesting</em>.  If your melody and your lyrics are really, really great, you can get by with this kind of minimalist harmony, but you probably want something better.</p>
<h4 class="question">This harmony is minimalist?  I thought minimalism kind of didn't do functional harmony.</h4>
<p class="text">That's <em>not what I meant</em>.  Come on, you know better than that.  But let's add some actual harmony to make the music prettier:</p>

<? createExample('Al Kol Eleh simple harmony'); ?>

<p class="text">This is as simple as it gets.  You should be able to improvise something like this if you know the melody, and if you don't know the melody, you can experiment with the bass lines a bit until you get something that sounds like this pretty quickly.  The bass has the root of each chord and the tenor has whatever else without moving around too much.  When you're improvising a harmony, you can generally just sing or play a note of the chord that isn't in the melody.  What I like to do when harmonizing is I figure out the melody note and the bass note and I sing whatever's left.</p>
<h4 class="question">But it's boring, though.</h4>
<p class="text">It <em>is</em> boring, and also, if you're singing the harmony here, you're not singing the words because you're not singing the pickups, the rhythms, etc.  So here are two things you can do if you're harmonizing with the singer: you can go a chord tone below or a chord tone above.</p>

<? createExample('Al Kol Eleh simple harmony 2'); ?>

<p class="text">This technique kind of requires you to figure out what the chord is and then just sing the next note up or down.  If there's a range issue, you can also go up or down two notes or an octave plus one note (three notes would be an octave).  And, if you get it wrong, it won't actually sound that bad.  For example, if in measure 2 you sang a C instead of a Bb... big whoop, you now have a vi chord, which still sounds good.  If you're good at harmonizing, you can spice up your harmony part too; in measure 2, the I chord is repeated, so why not change the second beat into a viio/ii and sing an E natural instead of an Eb?  At measure 4, Bb Bb Bb is boring, so why not sing Bb Ab G?</p>
<p class="text">When I arranged this piece for my old group Techiya in 2010, I did... all of those things.  I arranged it for five voices, and while there's a variety of textures and things going on throughout the piece, the first verse is homophonic, meaning that everyone has the same rhythm.  I don't have a recording of it sung, unfortunately, but here's the harmony:</p>

<? createExample('Al Kol Eleh Techiya harmony'); ?>

<h4 class="question">Why are there two Eb's in the first chord?</h4>
<p class="text">As I said, this is for five parts.  Sometimes, two parts have the same note, and that's how that goes.  The voices stay in order (uppermost is soprano, middle treble is mezzo-soprano, lower treble is alto, upper bass staff is tenor, lower bass staff is bass) except at the pickups to measure 2, where the alto has Eb going to D and the C going to D is the mezzo.</p>
<p class="text">This harmony is nothing more than a spruced-up version of the previous two examples, with a couple of reinterpretations.  First, the pickups are harmonized.  All of the voices have the same rhythm and the same words, so the effect is <em>homophony</em>; there was no sense in letting that go to waste by <em>not</em> harmonizing the pickups, right?  The harmonization here is the obvious one: the 1, Eb, gets harmonized with a I chord, and the 2 gets a V chord.</p>
<h4 class="question">Why I64 rather than just I?</h4>
<p class="text">Because the bass going Eb Bb Eb over such a short time would sound weird and disjointed.  These are singers, not timpani!  We want to arrive on a tonic in the bass, hence the 5-1 into the downbeat, but there's no reason for the first note of the pickup to be an arrival.  This way, we build a little bit of tension that we can release at that arrival.  There's a lot of crafting that goes into each of these chords.</p>
<h4 class="question">So how do you improvise something like this on the fly with other people?</h4>
<p class="text">Well, you don't.  It was a while ago, so I don't remember the details exactly, but I spent some time working on each chord until everything sounded right.  This five-part harmony is <em>composed</em> (and beat 2 of measure 1 has parallel fifths between the mezzo and tenor, so I guess I didn't even get everything perfect).  I took some basic ideas, which we're going to talk through presently, and fleshed out what I wanted each voice to do.</p>
<p class="text">The starting point for any harmonization is, of course, what does the melody imply, harmonically?  The second question, though, can sometimes be this: what <em>other</em> harmonic ideas fit the melody?  Then, we ask: how can the harmony flow better?  After that, it's just a matter of putting the pieces together such that they don't clash undesirably (of course, sometimes you <em>want</em> clashing</p>).</p>
<p class="text">So, from our basic frame in <? exampleLink('Al Kol Eleh reduction'); ?> (answering the first question), how can we zhoosh it up so that it sounds... not boring?  One of the first things that I see in the harmonic frame is that the I chord gets repeated a lot.  The easiest thing to do is to replace the I V I with a I V vi.  vi is a common substitute for I, and it also leads right into ii via the Circle of Fifths.  But vi - ii could be a bit smoother.  If you look at the alto at measure 2, we have the chance to create a scalar line, C Bb Ab, while we also smooth the transition by using the E natural and making the second chord a dominant 7th, the V7/ii, instead of a minor triad, the vi.  I - ii becomes vi - V7/ii - ii.  It's nicer, it's more exciting, and it's roughly equivalent, too; we made a substitution that prevents boredom, not a reharmonization.</p>
<p class="text">The second half of the phrase in the frame is just V for a while until it reaches I, which is also boring.  Too much of the same chord.  So we have an elaboration.  The bass starts at F, the 2, but root position for the V is the 5, so, instead of jumping straight there, it goes down in steps.  Ignoring the incidental harmony at the pickup to 3, we get to harmonize the bass scale at the same time as the melody.  The B natural (which, harmonically, should be a Cb, but it resolves up to C) makes the chord a viio65, which lives outside the major mode.  Chromaticism is exciting!  Beat 2 is just a passing harmony, because <em>something</em> needs to be there, right?  The ii chord does lead to the V chord (in this case, ii42 to V65, just like in Bach's Prelude 1 from WTC I in <? exampleLink('Prelude 1 Book I'); ?>), so the motion here is still smooth.  I couldn't find anything particularly interesting to do on beat 4, so the C in the bass is just a passing tone, but several things happen in measure 4.  In the alto, we have the Bb Ab G descending line that mirrors the C Bb Ab in measure 2, except that the second quarter note is actually two eighth notes because why not?  It breaks up the monotony of the homophony and gives the alto a little feature.  You'll recall that this melody actually happens twice in the verse; the eighth notes are only there the second time, not the first.  You can think about why I might have done that.  (I don't remember.)  The other thing is the mezzo; I <em>could</em> have just given the mezzo Bb's or something, but who doesn't like a major ninth?  The C is extremely pretty, even if Bach wouldn't have written it.  But I'm not Bach, am I?  What sells this C is that it resolves down chromatically to Bb, passing through Cb first.  It's a very relaxing progression.</p>
<p class="text">Most of this motion fits in the frame of the melody, and whatever doesn't is at least frame-adjacent.  I don't know if <em>you</em> personally liked it, but my group (and our audiences) did.  I think they would have still liked it if it were simpler, but meh.  It's not as interesting.</p>
<p class="text">Here, I just want to take a moment to talk a little bit about the composition and arrangement process, because I've seen my share of, well, pretty crappy arrangements where I had to do some massive rewriting.  You <em>actually have to think about all this stuff we're talking about</em>.  You have to actually figure out the harmonic frame (you don't need to write it down, but you do need to keep it in mind somehow), and you have to actually consider other harmonic possibilities, and you have to actually add the passing chords and melodic gestures to make it nice to listen to, and you have to actually use proper part writing and voice leading to make sure your music still sounds smooth.  If you're slavishly copying an existing recording in an arrangement, you can get by without doing the first three, but the proper voice leading is not optional.  I know that we haven't talked about part writing and voice leading yet, but <em>is</em> actually important, even if you're a guitar player.</p>
<p class="text">Anyway, before I sang Jewish/Hebrew/Israeli a cappella in Techiya, I sang tenor (and music directed) in the <a href="http://noteabl.es/">Noteables</a>, Harvard's Broadway Beat.  (They have a YouTube channel.  They uploaded the old videos.  I was there Spring 2005, Fall 2005, and Spring 2006.  You're welcome.)</p>
<h4 class="question">Eh, you're not that good.  Sorry.</h4>
<p class="text">I mean, you're not wrong, but did you really need to say it?  It hurts, man, it hurts.</p>
<p class="text">Regardless, when I was there, I picked up an appreciation for good Broadway music (i.e. Sondheim).  Before that, though, my parents listened to showtunes too, but mostly the more pop-ish songs; I can't count the number of times as a kid I had to listen to Barbra Streisand sing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWoQW-b6Ph8">Memory</a> from Cats.</p>
<h4 class="question">Andrew Lloyd Webber is <em>not</em> Stephen Sondheim.</h4>
<p class="text">He is most certainly not.  But it gives you an idea of what used to be popular when my parents were young, which is therefore what I was subjected to growing up.  My kids are growing up with Weird Al, a much better choice.</p>
<h4 class="question">I'm not... OK, never mind.  Go on with your tangent.</h4>
<p class="text">60's and 70's showtunes are not bad music.  And I'd like to harmonize one of them: The Impossible Dream, from Man of La Mancha, by Mitch Leigh (music) and Joe Darion (words).  This is going to be a sort of interesting challenge because, if you already know The Impossible Dream, you probably already know the harmony, and besides, I'm quite sure that Mitch Leigh had the harmony in mind as he composed the music.  Again, I won't provide an audio link right now, so you should sing or play the melody yourself first and try to understand its harmonic structure:</p>

<? createExample('The Impossible Dream melody'); ?>

<h4 class="question">It's in 9/8?  I thought it was in 4/4, or at least 12/8.</h4>
<p class="text">Wikipedia has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Impossible_Dream_(The_Quest)">long list</a> of notable renditions of The Impossible Dream.  I'm sure you can find many of them on YouTube, and some will undoubtedly be in 12/8 because... I'm not sure why.  To make dancing easier, perhaps.  But the original song from Man of La Mancha, from the show itself, is in 9/8, and that's how we're going to do it here.  It's actually fairly common for a standalone hit from a musical, whether a stage musical or a film musical, to have a radio version different from the version featured in the musical itself.  There are legitimate reasons for this.  For one, the singers in the musical are in character and might be actors first, while the radio version features singers who are not acting and are using popular style instead of musical style.  Second, the version from the musical presumably advances the plot, while the standalone version doesn't need to worry about that.  References to plot-specific things can be cut (and possibly replaced with generic text), and of course any dialogue that happens during the song in the musical is irrelevant without the context of the musical there.  For example, Frank Sinatra switches "to love pure and chaste from afar", which is specific to Don Quixote's knighthood fantasy, to "to be better far than you are", though he does stay in 9/8 (and there are other lyrics changes too).  I tend to prefer the musical-specific versions of things, for the most part.  I just feel like they're more authentic.  I don't <em>want</em> to sever the connection between the song and the musical.</p>
<h4 class="question">What's going on there at the end?</h4>
<p class="text">I've heard many different versions of this song, and each singer does a different thing.  One Broadway revival version I listened to actually repeats from the B1 section to the end, and the first time he sings the tonic on the last chord and the second time he goes up to the fifth.  I personally prefer the fifth, but they're all acceptable.  I guess that makes it real easy to figure out the final chord, huh?</p>
<h4 class="question">B1 section?</h4>
<p class="text">I labeled the sections just to make it easier to talk about them.  The first eight bars are section A; they repeat with a slightly different ending, so that's A'.  Then we get to the "chorus", the B section (it's not <em>really</em> a chorus, but it's big and high and loud).  There's a kind of natural split after 8 bars, but it's not a real cadence, so I'm separating the B section into B1 and B2 just to make it easier to think about it.  It's just one long B section, not two separate sections.  After B, we get a repeat of A, just with a different ending that actually lands on the tonic, so that's A''.  The structure of the piece is therefore a very standard AABA, but with a bit more granularity we can say A A' B1 B2 A''.</p>
<p class="text">Anyway, we're here for harmony, so let's figure some of that out.  We're going to start out with the A sections:</p>

<? createExample('The Impossible Dream A melody analysis'); ?>

<p class="text">This analysis is similar to what I did in <? exampleLink('Al Kol Eleh melody reduction'); ?> with the melody reduction of Al Kol Eleh, but this time I left the notation mostly as is instead of doing the thing with the beams.  Instead, I simply made the less important notes smaller.</p>
<h4 class="question">Which notes are less important?</h4>
<p class="text">The ones not on the downbeat and not at an extreme of the phrase — in other words, the passing tones.  You can see that, for the most part, the eighth note figures outline either a third or a full triad.  The third could be either of two chords, and the triad has just one possibility.  (By the way, I also combined A, A', and A'', which altered measure numbers from before.  Sorry!)  Let's start from the top, though my comments are mostly self-explanatory.</p>
<p class="text">Measure 1 starts with D - F, which, in the key of Bb, both indicate a I chord.  As the start of a piece, the I chord is perfectly appropriate, so we're going with that.  The next figure is D Eb F Eb D F, which essentially reinforces the D - F.  Note that D - F would also make sense as a Dm chord (if we didn't know the key), but the 2nd degree in Dm is E natural, not Eb, and we have an Eb.  That Eb orients us to Bb major.  Measure 3 has a very similar figure but a step up, so the relevant notes now are Eb and G.  Both the 4 and the 6 tend to suggest the IV more than the ii.  Measure 5 has an obviously outlined Dm, which is the iii, and measure 6 has Bb Eb in a downward fifth, which clearly outlines an Eb chord, the IV.</p>
<p class="text">Now, this is kinda weird.  Measures 1-2 have one chord, measures 3-4 have one chord, and now measures 5-6 have two chords.  The same will be true for 7 and 8.  7 clearly outlines a Cm chord, which is the ii, and 8 has a leading tone, the 7 of the scale, which suggests a V chord, especially since it's part of a ii - V turnaround that leads back to I (remember, a <em>turnaround</em> is a bit at the end of a section that leads back to the beginning of a section for a repetition).  We've taken a harmonic rhythm that has one chord every two measures in measures 1-4, but here in measures 5-8 it's one chord per measure.  This makes us think a little bit: what if we were wrong about the harmonic rhythm in measures 1-4, and actually there's only one measure per chord?</p>
<p class="text">Luckily, there were two interpretations possible for each of those chords anyway.  Changing from I to iii at measure 2 and from IV to ii at measure 4 helps create more of a sense of motion.  On my little note it says "(2nd time through)", but that doesn't mean to <em>play</em> the chord the second time through but rather to <em>read</em> the explanation the second time through.  If you read ahead in the music, you'll see that a one-measure harmonic rhythm is more appropriate than a two-measure harmonic rhythm.  (You'll also see this rhythm carrying through in the B section, with just one exception.)</p>
<p class="text">Measure 9 is identical to measure 6.  Measures 10 and 11 are up a third from measures 7 and 8.  You could argue that a IV chord fits measure 10 better than a ii.  I think the ii sounds better.  You're welcome to check what the many people who have recorded this song have done.  However, the C at measure 11 is very much a V, since this V chord leads into the "chorus" and the power of the V is needed.</p>
<p class="text">Measure 12 is mostly identical to 6, except for the pickup to the next measure.  (Note that in the actual song, the pickups in the A'' section are different from the pickups in the A and A' sections, but not in a way that matters.)  I'm going to skip 13 for a second and head to 14.  This is the final chord in the piece, so it's a I.  Different singers sing different scale degrees here, and this will generally depend on how impressive your high range is.  If you're a really high tenor, you even might go straight up to the octave Bb.  I happen to favor the fifth.  In any case, this is a final cadence, so the chord is a I.  My "Duh." is putting Descartes before the horse a bit, since the 1, 3, and 5 are sung <em>because</em> the final chord is a I, but final chords are final chords.  So that leaves us with measure 13.  What's going on here?</p>
<p class="text">It should lead us to the tonic, so it's a V chord.  But it outlines Bb and D (in the same pattern as measures 1 and 3, how motivic), which would form either a vi chord, which is not bloody likely at the final cadence, or a I chord, which... doesn't establish the <em>next</em> chord, which is when the arrival actually happens.  The best thing you can do (short of using multiple chords in that measure) is make it a I64: it has the notes of a I chord, but it's actually a dominant.  It could even be a V13 without a third.  Or with.  The simplest explanation, I think, is I64.  This gives us a <em>very</em> workable harmony for the "verses" of this song.  The eight-bar harmonic progression goes I - iii - IV - ii - iii - IV - ii - V, and for the most part, it's very heavily implied in the melody.</p>
<p class="text">But we are not so lucky in the chorus.  Let's see how this one works.</p>

<? createExample('The Impossible Dream B melody analysis'); ?>

<p class="text">This B section is as straightforward as the A section, except that...  Well, there's more ambiguity.  And the chord progressions don't make so much sense.  I - vi - iii, OK, that's a usual way to get to iii, which then generally proceeds to IV, but here it goes to V instead.  At 8 we get a half cadence on V, but it resolves to... ii?  Which repeats because basically we don't have anything better to do there, then we get three measures of dominant-equivalent and end up on the iv for some reason, in the only note in the piece that has an accidental.  By the way, it's a Gb and not an F# because it actually leads to the F at the downbeat of the A section.  If it were an F#, it would clearly be a D major chord (sharp accidentals are almost always leading tones and therefore the 3 of a V chord), which, also, what?  V/vi?</p>
<p class="text">Another couple of odd things are structural.  In the A section, we had everything in neat 2-measure phrases: "To dream... the impossible dream."  That's some conscious parallelism between the first of each pair and the second.  The arrival at the first is with a short upbeat (which gets longer in the A'' section), while the arrival at the second is more elaborate.  The important arrival is clearly the downbeat of the first of the pair ("dream" after "to"), so the pickups to the second ("the impossible" before "dream") are more about conveying the lyrics than about being load-bearing structural components of the phrase.  This changes radically here in the B section.  The arrival at measure 1 ("This is my quest") is actually a complete thought, as opposed to the A section, where the arrival at the first measure is "to dream", which is only the first half of a thought ("to dream the impossible dream").  This makes the arrival at measure 1 in the B section a much bigger deal than in the A section, and the first six bars of the B1 section work similarly, with bombastic declamations.  Measures 7 and 8 take a different approach, and we'll see the consequences shortly.  The arrival at 7 isn't much of an arrival at all, because the arrival note is hammered on each of the beats of the measure ("to be willing to MARCH into HELL for a HEAvenly CAUSE").  We're outlining the tonic chord, so the arrival at 7 really is an arrival, but it pushes through to measure 8.  Then it's the B2 section, which now has three-measure phrases and a downward contour, indicating a denouement from the climax of measure 7, down to the mention of death at that Gb that gets a non-diatonic minor chord.</p>
<p class="text">But does this harmony serve the melodic structure?  I don't like the chord repetition in measures 9-10 and 12-13.  The repeated hits of the D at measure 7 don't really seem to fit the harmonic rhythm either; those hits tend to deserve their own chords.  Let's listen to my rendition of this harmony and see what you think:</p>

<? createExample('The Impossible Dream B harmony bad'); ?>

<h4 class="question">Meh?  I like the bit where it goes from vi to IV at measure 6.  But something about this harmony just isn't doing it for me.</h4>
<p class="text">I agree.  I really think it's about those V's.  We'll talk about the vi - IV motion, because that holds one of the keys to understanding the true harmony of this piece.</p>
<p class="text">Let's briefly talk about this accompaniment.  I wrote it in a simple Spanish guitar style, and if some of the voicing choices are a bit weird (doubling the leading tone at 12, for example), it's because I wanted to stick to chords that are actually playable on the guitar (silly me for going with a recording in Bb instead of something more reasonable; eh, too late now).  We have a basic pattern that's similar to patterns used in other Spanish music like the very beginning of Joaquin Rodrigo's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQqH7zjqBlc">Concierto de Aranjuez</a> (this piece is <em>not</em> Spanish, but it is supposed to be somehow reminiscent of Spanish music since the show is set in Spain and Don Quixote is a Spanish nobleman), and that pattern gets changed at important junctures: the pickup into measure 1, the repeated high note at 7, the sad last chord.  It takes a bit of tweaking to come up with a beat I'm happy with.  I had to decide here whether to have the bass note as part of the <em>rasgueado</em> pattern (the fast chords in the guitar; "rasgueado" means "ripping" because that's the effect); I decided to leave it out.  I also added some dynamics to highlight the emotional contour of the music, as well as some 7ths in the repeated chords (measures 10 and 13) in order to avoid repeating too closely.</p>
<h4 class="question">The repetition still doesn't sit right with me.</h4>
<p class="text">You're right.  And I think now is the time to address that second question.</p>
<h4 class="question">Second question?</h4>
<p class="text">First question: what does the melody imply?  Second question: what else can you do with it?  In this case, we can take the model of the vi - IV that you liked and realize that moving down a major third from a minor chord to a major chord is a cool-sounding — and Spanish-sounding — motion.  We can apply it right at that repeated ii, making it ii - bVII.  And if we're going to use chromatic chords, why stop there?  That vi - IV?  What if it's vi - bVI instead?  Those arrivals on V, can they be anything else instead?  Let's look at what Mitch Leigh and Joe Darion <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHVGOp5Usv4">actually did</a> with this B section (I'm going to simplify it and still use my accompaniment pattern):</p>

<? createExample('The Impossible Dream B harmony good'); ?>

<h4 class="question">Whoa, that is... really different.</h4>
<p class="text">It is!  It also introduces us to a new harmonization: IV under a 2, as in measures 4 and 12.  To be fair, it's really a ii6 with an added 5 as a color tone, making it a ii65, but there are some chords where it makes more sense to think of the bass note rather than the root, and this is one of them.  This chord solves our earlier problem at measure 4.  We previously had iii - V, which is unsatisfying since we generally expect iii to go to IV or vi, but here, it goes to ii6 (well, ii65, but the 5 is not essential), which you can think of as a kind of IV.  In pop music, you'd write the chord as Eb6.  Generally, we use the added 6 as a color tone, just adding complexity to a chord without disturbing its primary sound, but when we harmonize a 2 with a IV chord, the "added 6th" is in the melody and it's an essential note to the sound of the chord.  The 5th, if present, is the only dissonance in there.  6th chords in general are a great tool to understand well since they help create interesting-sounding harmonies with a sound unique to them.</p>
<p class="text">In our earlier measures 5-6 we had vi - IV, but the original harmonies we see here are actually vi - bVI.  Let's think about this change a little bit.  What I see is that they actually sound pretty similar to each other.  vi - IV tonicizes the vi a little bit and IV is the bVI of vi.  vi - bVI keeps the focus on the tonic, but both progressions feature a bVI-sounding chord.  The original harmony changes the mode at this point, kinda, since it's going from vi in major to bVI borrowed from minor.  It's the same chord <em>function</em>, the submediant, using the same scale degrees, but in a different mode.  This kind of change isn't exactly functional harmony, but it's facilitated by the common tone in the melody.  When two chords are linked by a common tone, a lot of non-functional stuff actually sounds really good.  Incidentally, I don't think there was anything wrong with our choice of vi - IV for these two bars, but vi - bVI sets up a chromatic bass line that gets inverted at measure 7.</p>
<p class="text">Measure 6 looks like it has three chords, but it's really just one chord with a moving horn part.  I wouldn't call this the harmonic rhythm speeding up yet since it's just the one part that moves.  Measure 7 really does have a faster harmonic rhythm, though, to match the repeated declamations of the high note in the melody.  We call the chords in measure 7 a <em>line cliché</em> because some of the chord members stay still while the rest just move in a scale, in this case a chromatic scale.  You could call the chords in measure 6 a line cliché as well, and I think that actually works out given how the chords include even an aug6 chord!  The line cliché at 7 ends up on the bVII chord at 8 (it has a 7th as a color tone because that's what people did back in the 20th century; it's not essential to the harmony).  Here's the thing about that, though: it kind of makes sense later on to hear that bVII as a Neapolitan chord, the bII, in the key of the vi (Gm).  So, I analyzed the chords here both in Bb and in Gm so we can understand these relationships better.</p>
<p class="text">Notice how different measure 8 feels in the original harmony versus in our bad harmonization earlier.  The V chord we had for measure 8 was functional — and also, disappointingly, not functioning — but this one is a major chord for the sake of having a major chord.  That's a nice little trick when reharmonizing a melody: make the melody note the third of a chromatic major chord when you want a shot of major-ness in your music, and make it the third of a chromatic minor chord when you want a shot of minor-ness instead.  (The third is the easiest chord member to use, but really you can use any of them.)  That's what Mitch Leigh did at 6 and 8.  Now, why this trick?  I think I know why: Spanish music features a lot of phrygian harmony, which has bII chords.  To our more European ears, the bII chord is just this kind of a chromatic major chord that makes everything warmer, so Leigh took that concept and applied it to a variety of chords rather than just the phrygian bII.  For example, in the A section we saw iii - IV twice, which is essentially i - bII in phrygian.  Here in the B section, we see the same iii - IV or equivalent in measures 3-4 and also in 11-12, where (in Bb major) I analyzed the chord as V/vi but it's essentially III - IV.</p>
<p class="text">The arrival at the ii at 9 is similar to what we had in our version, but instead of repeating the ii at 10, we get a bVII instead.  The melodic outline has C and Eb, so if we wanted a chord that fits this outline, our basic choices for triads would be to add a Gb, making Cdim, G, making C minor, Ab, making Ab major, or A, making Adim.  Cdim can also be Cdim7 or Ab7, and Adim can also be F7 (and Cdim7 and its enharmonic equivalents).  The chords here that are diatonic to Bb major are the Cm and F7, which is what we tried, but the original harmony goes with the Ab and sounds especially adventurous when Don Quixote is singing about his quest.</p>
<p class="text">It's difficult to understand the function of the chord at 11, and that chord is why I also interpreted the chords in Gm.  You see, in Gm, the chords go bII - V, making the bII function as a Neapolitan chord.  Our chord here was a simple V in Bb major, and it didn't resolve anywhere.  It didn't sound adventurous.  This V in Gm acts as a III (or V/vi) in Bb major and goes to a IV-equivalent.  A very boring white-bread diatonic progression of V-I's (or just V's) simply doesn't fit the singer's impossible dream.</p>
<p class="text">The most difficult chord here, though, is at 13.  I've sung this song in my head countless times, so I knew the basic chord progression without needing a reference (though I didn't have the 7ths and passing tones and whatnot); until I specifically listened for it, I had no idea what chord would fit at 13.  I'm not sure that the chord that is there even fits at all.  For one, it's a dominant 7th (with a b9) on the leading tone, which is a V/iii, but it doesn't go to the iii.  For two, the melody note is the b3!</p>
<h4 class="question">Actually, now that you mention it, I don't see a C# anywhere.  How is this a V/iii?  Shouldn't it be a minor chord?</h4>
<p class="text">I don't believe so.  I think it sounds like a 7b9 chord more than a m7b9 chord.  If you put a C# in the guitar, I think it wouldn't sound out of place.  It would be more dissonant, though (I tried it), and it would be a less optimal voicing for the guitar.  Maybe the b9 was unnecessary.  If we really wanted it, we could have had it.  But there's not really any point.</p>
<p class="text">To make it even weirder, the chord's root is a tritone away from the bass notes of the two chords on either side.  We already did a tritone bass leap from 10 to 11.  Ignoring measure 14, there's a similar tritone leap from 12 to 13.  Both cases feature major chords moving to dominant chords a tritone away, much like a bII - V Neapolitan motion.</p>
<p class="text">However.  Look at 14 now.  We have a fairly sad iv equivalent (honestly, it's just that added C that messes things up; I think calling this chord a m6 instead of ø65 would be warranted), which is really the only option for this Gb.  We had it in our analysis too.  But.  If you look at the melody at 13, the Gb really should be an F#, and that would make the chord a D major or D7 by virtue of the chromatic note F# being a leading tone.  And, if it were D major, measures 12-14 would be bII - V - I in D.  But the chord we do get, the Ebm6, is a surprise — a sad surprise, as the singer talks about his upcoming demise, but still a surprise.  bII - V - I is a very Spanish-sounding progression, especially with the b10 in the V, for two reasons: first, the bII is used in phrygian, and second, Spanish music specifically in phrygian has a confused third in its tonic chord, since there are two possible third degrees of the Spanish scale (b3 and 3).  The tonic chord is I, but the b3 features melodically, so the dominant 7th with a b9 and b10 is a characteristic sound of Spanish phrygian music.  Furthermore, there's often deliberate confusion about whether the mode is minor or phrygian, such that the V of the minor mode is the I of the phrygian mode.  Even though the bII and V belong to different Spanish phrygian scales, they do both belong to Spanish phrygian scales and provide unity to the progression.</p>
<h4 class="question">Why does this progression sound <em>good</em>?</h4>
<p class="text">We just spent several paragraphs answering that question?</p>
<h4 class="question">No, no, I mean, why does this progression sound good while the harmonization we did doesn't?  There were some things that didn't make functional sense in that harmonization, but there were also things that didn't make functional sense in the original progression.  Is it arbitrary?  Is it just personal taste?</h4>
<p class="text">Ultimately, it's the job of the composer to create meaningful and smooth melodies and harmonies.  That <em>is</em> personal taste to an extent, but when it comes to harmony, it's very easy to end up with something that just sounds... stale.  There are a few ways to combat this staleness.  One: use chromaticism.  Your harmonies can make absolutely no sense, but if they're chromatic (and there's some sort of melody or other unifying factor that does make sense), they will just sound interesting.  Two: be directed.  Even if the harmonies don't really function, so long as leading tones resolve where you expect (or have their resolutions denied conspicuously), you're pretty much good.  Melodies should head in the direction they feel like they should go, too.  Three: repetition.  Repeat motifs, rhythms, chord progressions, everything.  Anything becomes acceptable if you repeat it often enough.</p>
<h4 class="question">Didn't Hitler say that?</h4>
<p class="text">Turns out... kinda, yeah.  He didn't say it himself, but it was said in his psychological profile that one of his guiding principles is that if you repeat a lie enough, people will come to believe it.  Used in music, I think it's a bit more benign than when Hitler used it to murder millions of people.  But the downside of repetition is that it also <em>causes</em> staleness when you expect something to change and it doesn't, or when you hear the same sonority too much in a passage where it logically shouldn't repeat.  The basic rule is that if you repeat something too few times, you're unoriginal, but if you repeat it many times, it's a pattern.  How many times will depend on what you're repeating, of course.</p>
<p class="text">Let's see examples.  In our harmonization of the B section of The Impossible Dream above, we tried to stick to the harmonies implied by an almost completely diatonic melody, but the original progression uses plenty of chromatic chords like bVII's (which we can reinterpret as bII's) and bVI's.  In our harmonization, while the melody is nice and directed, the chords have iii - V's and V - ii's that are at odds with how these chords usually progress, cutting the forward motion.  The original progression maintains clear directionality by the means of passing chords and inverted chords.  Our harmonization doesn't really have much repetition in the harmony (the melody is a different story), and when it does, it's nothing significant being repeated, leading to staleness.  The original progression doesn't have much repetition at all either, but it has far more directed harmonies so it doesn't need repetition to establish anything.</p>
<p class="text">This next piece we'll handle a bit differently, since there's no canonical harmonization as everyone records it differently.  Here's Tristeza, by Haroldo Lobo and Niltinho:</p>

<? createExample('Tristeza', true); ?>

<h4 class="question">Have we seen this before?  We have, it says "(again)" in the caption.  I knew it sounded familiar.</h4>
<p class="text">We've seen it a few times now, actually.  But this time, we're going to harmonize it.  Here's my harmonic analysis of the melody:</p>

<? createExample('Tristeza melody analysis'); ?>

<p class="text">It's worth doing some melodic analysis too, because that will inform the harmonies we choose.  There are three sections: measures 0-7 feature a rise, measures 8-15 feature a fall, and measures 16-22 feature the same fall again.  In each of these, there's a clear 2-measure repeating bit.  Measures 1, 3, and 5 are the same thing but a step higher each time, same with measures 2 and 4 (but 6 avoids it).  On the way down, we have 8, 10, and 12 being basically the same but a step lower each time, and 9, 11, and 13 would have that relationship except that 11 is a whole note instead of a funky rhythmic thing.  Then, measures 16-22 restate that whole 9-15 segment but with less rhythmic elaboration, and the upward sixth of measures 1, 3, and 5 becomes a downward step in measures 16, 18, and 20.  So we can see that this is a tight little tune, and we're going to want to use this structure in our harmony.</p>
<p class="text">Now, the harmony that's implied is really basic, and there are a few things wrong with it.  Or, at least, I think they're wrong.  The first is the V in measure 2.  I just don't hear it.  When I show you my harmonization below, you'll see what I mean, but I'm not convinced by V going to ii; that's a retrogression, not a progression.  That said, while I like ii in measure 3, some people actually would do IV there and V at 5.  That sounds good too!  It's not how I do it, but people make it work.  The thing is that a scale like what you find at 2 and 4 doesn't <em>really</em> outline anything.  It kinda looks like it does, but it doesn't really.  You could use pretty much anything on a scale like that.  And we'll see that "anything" in action, because we're free to pick chords that fit the function we're going for instead of the melody itself in this situation.</p>
<p class="text">In measure 8, the V/IV should really be V7/IV.  Why?  So that you don't have the same chord twice in a row.  Movement is good.  That 7 isn't diatonic to F, but since the secondary dominant nature of the chord is so clear here, that's not a problem.  The difficulty is that with the I - V7/IV - IV in measures 7-9, what do we do with the IV - I in 10-11?  It sounds stale.  One nice trick for repeating IV chords is to make the second one minor, and since the third isn't actually present in the melody at 10, making it iv works.  If that's the situation, then maybe 11 shouldn't be a I.  What if it's a iii?  Then measures 11-15 will be one long circle of fifths sequence: iii - vi - ii - V7 - I.  I like that.  Except that the vi maybe could be a V/ii?  Maybe.  Then, 16-22 just repeats the chords.</p>
<p class="text">Well, let's take a look at my harmonization.  Reharmonization, rather.  Er, arrangement:</p>

<? createExample('Tristeza harmony'); ?>

<h4 class="question">This is pretty different from what I expected!  I like this a lot.  But you also changed some stuff, right?</h4>
<p class="text">Thank you!  I did change some stuff, but only slightly: I changed the trumpet to a flute, and I added a stinger at the end (for which I needed to make a 2nd ending, bar 23).</p>
<h4 class="question">What's a cavaquinho?</h4>
<p class="text">You can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavaquinho">look it up</a>.  It's a small guitar, originally from Portugal; if you're familiar with the ukulele, that's basically a cavaquinho.  The strings are generally tuned D G B D or D G B E in Brazil, an octave above the guitar's upper four strings (for this arrangement I assume the latter, and hopefully I didn't write something unplayable!).  The cavaquinho is a very common instrument in Brazilian music, which is why I used it here, relegating the guitar to basically just playing the bass and tenor.  My Sibelius sound library doesn't have a sound for it, but the mandolin sound is close enough, I think.</p>
<p class="text">Before we get into the harmony, I want to comment on the rhythm and the general structure of the arrangement process.  It took me a few hours to write the first draft of the arrangement, going off of my memory of some versions of this song that I've heard as well as, of course, trial and error.  I specifically didn't listen to any of those versions while writing it, so I went from my fairly hazy memory of harmonies I've heard and had to compose most of it from first principles, though I'm sure you'll find commonalities with other recordings.  I think the rhythm at 15 is something I've heard in another recording, for example, and the general rhythmic approach is something I've heard in bossa nova recordings but it's not samba.  Samba has heavy percussion and a strong 16th note beat, usually around strong beats that look like dotted eighth sixteenth eighth eighth.  This rhythm is <em>not that</em>.  This is a bossa nova rhythm through and through, busy and filled with syncopation, and it even starts with two straight eighths on each bar in the cavaquinho, which some call the 2-3 "<a href="http://www.rockdrummingsystem.com/underground/drum-beats/clave-bossa.php">bossa nova clave</a>" (there's no such thing, don't listen to them).  The rhythm actually doesn't exactly line up, but it's close enough, if you also fill in some of the rests.</p>
<h4 class="question">So... it's a different rhythm entirely?</h4>
<p class="text">Not quite.  If you look at the page I linked, the so-called bossa nova clave is just a syncopated clave, and the bass — usually the bottom strings on the guitar — play a straight rhythm, filling in the rests.  The rhythm I wrote in the cavaquinho has that clave, syncopated a little bit differently, with more hits instead of bass notes.  It's not the same rhythm exactly, but it's very related.  Still, the whole concept of the bossa nova clave is that Latin jazz music generally has a <em>clave</em> rhythm — that's either the 3-2 clave, dotted eighth, dotted eighth, quarter, quarter rest, quarter, quarter, quarter rest (count like this: <strong>1</strong> (2) <strong>and</strong> (3) <strong>4</strong> (1) <strong>2 3</strong> (4)), or the 2-3 clave, which just flips the two bars ((1) <strong>2 3</strong> (4) <strong>1</strong> (2) <strong>and</strong> (3) <strong>4</strong>).  See the example below.  The rhythm from the Tristeza arrangement is there for comparison, though the note values were doubled so that it would look similar to the other rhythms; the wedges are where I added a hit that's not in the clave.</p>

<? createExample('clave'); ?>

<p class="text">Trouble is, Brazilian "jazz" music is almost completely unrelated to Latin jazz.  I put "jazz" in quotes because it's... well, it's similar to jazz.  But it's not similar to <em>Latin</em> jazz.  While rhythms like the so-called "bossa nova clave" do show up, they're really just funky syncopations more than any kind of rhythmic basis.  The melody of Tristeza has these long notes that are begging for some real busy stuff underneath, and it doesn't much matter if it's a samba beat or a bossa nova beat, so long as it's busy.  In contrast, Latin jazz is basically built around that clave.  The rhythm is called a clave because it's played on the claves, by the way; Brazilian music uses a completely different instrumentation.  It just doesn't make sense to try to lump bossa nova in with Latin jazz just because Brazil happens to be in Latin America.</p>
<p class="text">The rhythm in the guitar, though, that's not a standard rhythm in bossa nova.  I just like the 3 against whatever that's happening on the second half of the bar.  Look how cool that is.  I could have gone for simple quarter notes, but what fun would that be?  I didn't want the guitar to line up with the cavaquinho except on beat 1 (and occasionally beat 2 when the rest is filled in).  Drag triplets do that.  And it makes things feel way busier, which is awesome, right?</p>
<p class="text">So, on to the harmony.  I added lots of motion, and it's good to be able to distinguish the important motion, which sets the harmonic rhythm, to stuff that's less important.  To start, let's compare the first section, measures 1-7, between the analysis in <? exampleLink('Tristeza melody analysis'); ?> and the arrangement in <? exampleLink('Tristeza harmony'); ?>.  In the arrangement, the first two bars go I - I7 - I(add6) - viiø65/ii, while in the analysis, they go I - V.  Why didn't I use a V?  Because that would sound silly.  The melody in bar 2 is a scale.  In fact, there's no need to change the harmony from the I of the first chord!  What I did was make it a <em>line cliché</em>: I kept all the voices constant in the first three chords but moved just one voice.  We go from something like F A C F to F A C E to F A C D.  The next chord is just a passing secondary dominant to help lead into the ii in the next bar (remember, viiø chords function as dominants).  The F# is a passing tone between the F and the G, so I would consider this viiø/ii chord as a passing chord.  The primary harmonic rhythm, then, is a chord for two bars.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 3 and 4 in the arrangement go ii - ii7 - bVII6 - viio65/iii, and in the analysis they go ii - vi.  It's the same problem here; the second bar in the set simply doesn't need a new chord since it's just a scale.  The chords I wrote are decoration.  The viio65/iii is, again, a passing dominant, just like in measure 2, with the G# a chromatic passing tone from the G to the A, but that's not what's interesting: that Eb is what's interesting!  What's <em>that</em> doing there?  I voiced it as a descending line in the top of the cavaquinho part: G - F - Eb.  However, I really hear that Eb more as coming up from the D.  I really want to hear Eb at that moment for some reason, but it clashes with the E on beat 4 so it has to only be in the first half of the bar.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 5, 6, and 7 don't change much.  The arrangement goes iii - iii7 - ii7 - V7 - I (stopping at the first half of 7), while the analysis goes iii - V7 - I.  It's practically the same, except that there's a bit of a line cliché in the iii chord, and the V7 - I is expanded into a ii7 - V7 - I.  This substitution of a ii - V for a solitary V is quite common in jazz, since ii - V is a more complete progression and the ii smoothly leads to V.  (Sometimes it's V/V - V, which is functionally the same thing.)  Note also that the V7 is actually more of a V11; the tonic is present in the chord as a kind of pedal tone.  In the second half of 7, the rhythm changes as a kind of transition into the next section beginning at 8.  We have these two pickup notes; I considered just doing unison F's then E's (we're leading to the Eb in measure 8 to bring out the change from I to V7/IV), but I felt that we could get much the same effect without losing the harmony by using the voicing I used: the guitar has three octaves of F's then three octaves of E's, and that gives those scale degrees emphasis while keeping a basic harmony.</p>
<p class="text">Now let's move on to the next section, measures 8-15.  In the arrangement, measures 8-9 go V7/IV - IV, and in the analysis, they also go V/IV - IV.  Kept it simple.  Except that the Eb is suspended at measure 9.  Both chords also change position on beat 3 of the bar, but I didn't feel that was an important enough change; I feel that the beat 1 downbeat is still the "true" bass note.  You're of course welcome to disagree.</p>
<p class="text">In measures 10-11, my arrangement has iv - bIIdom7/vi - vi (ish), while the analysis has IV - I, which we also talked about it being a iv and a iii instead.  Well.  I think this in particular deserves some good discussion.</p>
<h4 class="question">How does it make sense to have a bIIdom7 as a secondary chord?</h4>
<p class="text">This is a situation of composition first, analysis later.  That's really how all music should be written.  I wanted to change chords on beat 3 of 10, so I did a jazz thing and I thought of the Bbm as a ii chord and expanded it to ii7 - V7 in the key of... Ab.  We're not actually in Ab, but the ii7 - V7 sound is common enough in jazz, and we can actually hear the Eb7 chord as a Neapolitan in D, since we're going to D7 at measure 12.  Only problem, Eb7 - Am doesn't sound right, or at least I couldn't get it to work.  I spent quite a while listening and re-listening to this piece, trying to think of ways I could make the first two beats of measure 11 sound right.  What I have there is the best I could come up with, but I'm not 100% happy with it, and... that's OK.  If I were releasing this arrangement commercially, or performing it or something, you better believe that I'd make sure I was very happy with all of it, but as an example in this book, I figured that maybe it's actually good that it's not quite perfect, because then you get some more insight into the process.  The process was a whole bunch of trial and error.  I wanted the bass to go in fourths/fifths to make a sequence: you'd get Bbm - Eb7 - Am - D7.  But I could not get a voicing of the Am to sound right (especially against the Bb in the melody at bar 18, which has the same harmony).  I thought A7 might work, but also no.  So I settled on Dm with A in the bass.  I wanted some scalar motion in the first two beats, and I tried various things but the one that sounds the least bad is C# - C (which also required filling in the downbeat of 2 in the cavaquinho), making DmM7/A in the first beat and Dm7 in the second.  I didn't bother changing the inversion of the chord in the Roman numeral because I think A is still the "true" bass at this point.  I'm a bit unhappy about the top voice in the cavaquinho going C# - C - D - C#; it's a bit too chromatic.  But there you go.  The change in rhythm on beat 3 is a direct callback to measure 7, where a similar thing happens.  There, we had I becoming V7/IV; here, we have vi becoming V7/ii.  In both cases, a diatonic chord becomes a secondary dominant on the same root.  Parallelism!</p>
<p class="text">In measures 12-13, the arrangement goes V42/ii - viio6 - V/V - V7/V, where the analysis goes vi - ii.  Honestly... it's the same thing.  The arrangement is just more fun!  To turn the vi into V42/ii, all we do is raise the third, add a seventh, and invert the chord a bit.  There's one extra thing I did, which was to add a b13 to the chord on beat 3, the Bb.  That's just a color tone; it doesn't change how the chord behaves fundamentally.  At 13, again, ii is the same as V/V, only V/V has a raised third.</p>
<h4 class="question">So what's up with that viio6?</h4>
<p class="text">Eh, just noodling around!  I wanted E - Eb - D, and I figured that it was best to use a Bb under the E and B natural under the Eb.  The Eb is therefore also a b13.  Really, the chord isn't changing fundamentally.</p>
<p class="text">14-15 in the arrangement is V9 - V43 - I - V65/IV - V7/IV, and in the analysis, it's V7 - I.  I think those are the same too.  The 9th is just a color tone, and the change of inversion is pretty insignificant; maybe I shouldn't even have labeled it.  At 15, though, something interesting happens: we get a little transition into the chorus.  Going from the first half of the verse to the second (measures 7-8) involved going from I to V/V over two measures, but here we only get one, so the transition is a bit compressed.  My intention was to basically stop the action, and the <em>sudden</em> 4 against 3 rhythm (four dotted eighths against three beats) is a popular way to effect such a stop (another being sudden drag triplets).  The accompaniment comes in louder at 16 (which I didn't mark) to create the effect of an emotional <em>shout chorus</em>, the final chorus at the end of a jazz piece where the improvisation stops and everyone just plays the theme triumphantly.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 16-23 are the same as measures 9-15, mostly.  The obvious change is the ending, which measure 15 is not but measures 22 and 23 are.  22 has a little turnaround — the C in the guitar leads to the beginning of the piece again; 23 has a more definitive ending, with the high note in the flute.  More subtly, the voicing at the second half of 14 was changed at the second half of 21 to have the E as the top note instead of the bottom note in the cavaquinho.  I know, <em>huge</em> whoop.</p>
<p class="text">Overall, the harmony in the arrangement isn't all that different from the analysis.  The differences mostly come down to spicing up various chords and inserting passing sonorities.  The composition process is fairly simple for a harmonization of a melody: first, I understood what the melody was telling me about the harmony; second, I used my imagination (and memory of other performances) to get other ideas for more adventurous harmonies; third, I worked out the smaller details of how I could get moving lines and non-harmonic tones in the accompaniment.  I should mention that I deliberately <em>didn't</em> worry too much about voice leading here, because I just don't think it's very important in this particular arrangement and instrumentation.  The limitations of the instruments were more important (to me).  I still tried to avoid glaring parallels, but I didn't sweat it too much when a few slipped through.  If I were writing for independent vocalists, getting the voice leading right would have been a much higher priority than when writing for guitar and cavaquinho.</p>
<p class="text">One final thing I noticed is the similarity in the cavaquinho part between what I did and Chopin's Prelude Nº4 in Em (<? exampleLink('Chopin Prelude 4'); ?>).  The voices tend to also move down one at a time chromatically, though I wasn't as strict and focused about it as Chopin was.  At first, the similarity might seem intentional, but it turns out that it's there whenever chords move smoothly.  When you go from one chord to the next, it's often a good idea to move each voice as little as possible, so my insistence on adding chromatic passing tones and passing chords set up similar conditions as are in Chopin's prelude.  Try to see how much music out there follows a similar type of pattern!</p>
<p class="text">So there, we've done three harmonizations.  Next, we're going to do some more radical <em>re</em>harmonization:</p>

<h3 class="subsection-title" id="reharmonizing">9.7.3 Reharmonizing a Melody</h3>

<p class="text">When I say "reharmonization", what do you think of first?</p>
<h4 class="question">Jazz reharmonizations, of course.  Tritone subs, ii - V's, etc.</h4>
<p class="text">Oh.  Not Bach chorales?</p>
<h4 class="question">Not Bach chorales, no.</h4>
<p class="text">Bummer.  Because that's what we're going to do now!</p>
<h4 class="question">Yaaaay.  My excitement cannot be contained.  Yay.</h4>
<p class="text">When we do a reharmonization, the question is no longer "what harmony is implied by this melody" but rather "what harmony is possible with this melody", and the answer is <em>literally anything</em>, except that you still have to decide what sounds good and what doesn't.  The goal becomes to write an interesting harmony, not just to accompany the melody.  The result can be, basically, arbitrarily rich.  Let's suppose we want to have a chorale, which is a fairly slow piece sung one note at a time.  We have a given melody, some old German tune or whatever.  What do we do?  We pick a chord to go with each melody note.  The melody note can be the root of the chord, or the third, or the fifth.  Or the seventh, if it resolves properly.  Or, if you're writing more modern music, it can also be the 9th, the 11th (or #11th), the 13th, etc.  Or it could be a non-harmonic tone, depending on how it moves; that's a possibility too.  We've already seen the chart:</p>

<? createExample('chord possibilities', true); ?>

<p class="text">Here, though, we're looking at the chart a bit differently.  Before, we had a melody note and we were trying to figure out what harmony it implied, and we used the order of the chords on this chart to get the most likely possibilities.  Now, we're using this chart for inspiration in our own harmonizations.  The chart covers only diatonic chords, though, so don't forget that there's the possibility for a modulation, secondary chords, and other chromatic chords (depending on the style).  In vocal music, you typically don't want to be <em>too</em> out there because then your music becomes unsingable.  Then again, good singers can do it anyway, right?</p>
<p class="text">Let's do an example.  Here's a melody by Johann Schop from 1642, <a href="http://www.bach-cantatas.com/CM/Werde-munter.htm">Werde munter, mein Gemüthe</a>, taken from one of my top 389 favorite Bach chorales, number 363.</p>
<h4 class="question">Did you decide that using a random number generator?</h4>
<p class="text">No...  Yes.  Shut up.</p>

<? createExample('Werde munter'); ?>

<p class="text">The melody here is presented in A major, but let's assume that we can transpose it if we want.  If we wanted to read the harmonies that are present, measure 1 would be a I chord, measure 2 a V, measure 3 a I, measure 4 a V - I, measure 5 a V, measure 6 a I - V, measure 7 a IV, measure 8 a V/IV - IV, measures 9-12 the same as 1-4.  The structure is AABA (notice that measures 1-4 repeat).  But this is really, really boring.  I'm sure we can do better.  Let's give it a try.  The basic template when writing chorales is to use two staves, treble and bass, with two voices on each.  So we'll do that (assuming we're playing piano, even though this is a vocal piece):</p>

<? createExample('Werde munter template'); ?>

<p class="text">We want to harmonize this in the style of Bach.</p>
<h4 class="question">Why?</h4>
<p class="text">Because I said so?  We'll do other styles later, but Bach's chorales are a great example of <em>functional</em> harmony, and that's what we're mostly interested in right now.  We want all of these chords to have functional relationships.  Bach's style was to be as harmonically adventurous as he could within the confines of what was acceptable in his time, so we're going to try to stick to Common Practice conventions (maybe not <em>entirely</em> to the style of Bach himself) at least for this example.</p>
<p class="text">The idea is simple: which chord would you put on each note?  You should write mostly quarter notes, but some eighth notes are OK.  Voice leading rules should be followed, but we haven't actually learned those yet so... well, I'm doing this reharmonization, not you.  Doesn't really matter.  Modulations (oh yes, they're allowed) should be only to keys closely related to the key of the piece, which are those keys with ±1 accidental in the key signature.  From A major, then, we can go to D (–1#), Bm (–1#), F#m (+0#), E (+1#), and C#m (+1#).  And the piece should end on the tonic (A major), though for modal tunes in phrygian this becomes a problem.  Luckily the present tune is in plain major.  The spots with fermatas are cadences, but we don't really need to use cadential formulas here (which we haven't talked about yet either).  Modal mixture is fine, but remember that this is Common Practice so minor needs to follow the rules of melodic minor.  That's probably about it.</p>
<p class="text">It would be great to do this in steps, but that's not how I write music, so I won't do that.  Instead, I'll show you the finished product and explain how I got there.  But maybe you should first spend a little time thinking about how you might do this.</p>

<p class="text">This took about two to three hours of really finicky work.  To be fair, I was deliberately trying to be as "out there" as possible within the bounds of the problem, but still, it's really finicky regardless.  You want it to sound good and not stale, and you want it to flow logically, and you want to avoid parallel fifths, bad spacing, all that stuff.  So you have some creative idea, you put it to practice, and... it turns out to be impractical.  So you have to go back.  And you also have to keep it consistent throughout the entire chorale.  When I was writing this, I had to fight all of these.  At one point, I had a crying baby in one hand and I was composing with my other hand.  I took a look and I realized that the measures I'd written had no eighth notes!  It took a lot of effort to come up with the chords, and then it took some more effort to go over the entire chorale a few times and spruce it up where appropriate.  One of the things I tried to do after the first draft was to add more eighth notes where it made sense to do so, and I realized that in the bass part at measure 5, I'd written a little motif, the D C# C# B eighth notes.  So, guess what?  I took every opportunity to add it wherever I could find the space.  It helps that there are two ways to look at two eighth notes: harmonic followed by non-harmonic, or the reverse (or both harmonic, but that's less interesting).  At measure 4, for example, the bass was previously B G# A, but I added the eighth notes to fill in the gap between the B and G#.  At 7, on the other hand, the tenor on beats 3 and 4 had C B, but I changed it to C B B A, with the first B an anticipation and the A a neighbor tone to the B at measure 8.  I think that, in the end, I was able to get a lot of mileage out of that motif.  Motifs are <em>not</em> especially important in chorale writing, so I could have used it just once and left it at that, but I noticed another spot where it might have been useful, and from there I realized I could hide a lot of the imperfections of the piece by sprinkling it liberally with motivic elements so that you think, "wow, cool motifs" instead of "meh, shoddy harmonies and part-writing".</p>
<p class="text">As for the harmonies, the analysis is possibly a bit conservative in terms of modulation, but really it's all just chromatic anyway, with only the subtlest hint of functional thinking.  My first idea when harmonizing this melody was that it should absolutely <em>not</em> start on I.  So, we have C# - D, what can we do?  Going up a minor second recalls a leading tone going to the tonic, 7 - 1, which in this case would be A7 - D.  It could also be 3 - 4, and there are different ways of harmonizing that: A - D, A - Bm, F#m - Bm, etc.  I chose to interpret it as 2 - b3 in Bm, so that's F#7 - Bm.  But then I saw that I could have a long descending chromatic line from the A# if I did things right, and I also realized that in an F#7 the 7th, E, would have to resolve down to D, doubling that note.  I suppose I could have done F#7 - D, but that's more Schubert than Bach.  So, I did F# - Bm7 and added a chromatically descending line in the tenor, which I tragically had to cut short on beat 2 of measure 2 because I couldn't get the E# to work the way I wanted it to.  Semiprotip, though, diminished 7th chords can actually be pretty useful.  I managed to fit both an A# and a Bb in the same measure this way.  If I tuned the chorale to something other than 12-TET, you'd even be able to hear it.</p>
<h4 class="question">Huh, I wonder what that might sound like...</h4>
<p class="text">Oh, fine.  Here it is in 31-TET.  It's not that different:</p>

<? createExample('Werde munter reharmonization 31-TET'); ?>

<h4 class="question">What changed?</h4>
<p class="text">Not very much.  The thirds became more in tune and the fifths became less in tune.  And the A#'s and Bb's became different notes, and the diminished 7th chords became asymmetrical.  But we're going to talk all about that in a later chapter.</p>
<p class="text">In measure 2, I wanted the cadence on B major instead of B minor just to be different.  It could be thought of as a mini-modulation to E major, except that E major is absolutely not established, so I guess it isn't!  My main concern here was connecting each chord to the next, not so much maintaining a sense of key, and that's how we ended up with the viio7/IV at measure 1 and the viio7/ii at measure 2, both of which are the same chord (in 12-TET) but spelled differently.  Other than the V42 in measure 1 and the V/V in measure 2, you could even think of the entire two-measure phrase in B minor, and even then, the E7 chord on beat 3 of measure 1 could simply be said to have an irregular resolution, and the cadential B major could be a I chord.  Your mileage may vary on the analysis, I think, but you can hopefully see the kinds of chords I was going for.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 3 and 4 I was trying to get back to A major for the cadence.  That wasn't strictly necessary; I could have done a cadence on F# minor or D major, though the latter would have been a bit tricky given the melody: 6 - 5 isn't a usual melody for a full cadence, so it would be a much weaker cadence.  As it is, the current cadence is somewhat weak because the V chord is not in root position.  This is a common trick in Baroque (and earlier and later) music to keep endings not so final until the final cadence, which <em>is</em> in root position.  The first chord in measure 3 was a bit tricky to get, because I needed a decent resolution from the B major.  What did I do?  Deceptive cadence in E major.  Kinda.  Look at this.  The V chord is B major, so the I chord is E major, and the vi chord, where deceptive cadences (in major) go instead of the tonic, is C#m.  But this C#m is chromatically altered to C#dim, so it can smoothly go to D major.  You can see that there's more going on than is evident in just the analysis.</p>
<p class="text">With the GM7 at measure 5, we have to be in D major, but that only lasts a bar.  Why?  I wanted a new harmony for the C# in measure 6, so I modulated to F#m.  But how was I going to get back from F#m?  Clever idea: diminished 7th chord at the cadence.  Now look at this bit of stable genius: the cadence is an E#dim7 chord, the viio7 in F#m.  I wanted to use that in another key, where I'd need an F instead of an E#, but that's a problem because the diminished second from E# to F is problematic in a functional context.  Some Renaissance composers did actually use stuff like this in their microtonal experiments (more on this much later), but it's very much outside of Bach's style to do such a thing, so I just dropped the E# altogether, and hey, now I have a viio in A!</p>
<h4 class="question">I thought you weren't supposed to write root position viio chords?  Or, for that matter, double the leading tone?</h4>
<p class="text">Yeah...  In my defense, though, we don't hear that interpretation.  The bass pretty much has to jump up an octave because things were getting too low, and large leaps that aren't an octave are too awkward.  The disappearing E# doesn't really change the chord, so you don't really hear the G# as a leading tone; you just don't hear the leading tone at all, because that was the E#.  It does not sound like the leading tone is in the bass until the chord resolves, and the doubled G# is even less of a problem here because one of them resolves down to G natural.</p>
<p class="text">Speaking of G naturals, measures 7 and 8 are in G major, but I had said that that key was out of limits, so I analyzed it as D major.</p>
<h4 class="question">Isn't that cheating?</h4>
<p class="text">Yes.  What are <em>you</em> gonna do about it, punk?  Fact is, though, in D major, you <em>could</em> have a brief tonicization of G, so the Am7 - D7 - GM7 isn't too much of a problem.  The thing that's tough to reconcile is the CM7 after it, and also the fact that the CM7 - A7 - D sounds more like a IV - V/V - V in G than... IV7/IV - V65 - I in D.  Yeah, that's cheating.  But, in my defense, the chords form a circle of fifths sequence.  Sequences trump other rules.  So there.</p>
<p class="text">The last four bars have the same melody as the first four, but I thought it was necessary to do something a little different harmonically (as did Bach).  That said, bar 9 and bar 1 are basically the same, except that the chords are inverted differently, and that last Bb is actually an A.  The part where it's different is in measure 10; the second chord is an F#m instead of the diminished 7th equivalent of an F#7 (A#dim7), keeping us firmly in D major instead of some form of B minor, and the cadence is to G major.  Then, at 11 and 12, we again have the same basic harmonic structure as 3 and 4, with some small differences.  The viio7 chords have become V7's, for example.  Another thing I wanted to do is add the E# at beat 3 to lead to the F# at beat 4, but there's a little problem here, isn't there?  The melody has an E natural!  I originally had the E# as a quarter note, creating a false relation, but that sound is not very Baroque at all, so I did what I think Bach might have done: I doubled the E in the alto in the first eighth note so that I could move it to E# in the second without a cross-relation and without clashing with the soprano (which I analyzed as a non-harmonic passing tone, but it's really a b9 in a dominant 7th).  The downbeat of 12 is also something I went back and forth on; I figured that, since I started the piece with a descending chromatic line, I might end it with an ascending one, but I couldn't get a G natural in the tenor to make the cadence sound final enough.  I also considered a V7/V instead of a ii7, but, again, it didn't sound final enough.  The diatonic final measure helps ensure that we're really ending in the key of A.  We actually also have a circle of fifths going into the ending here, which was obscured in measures 3 and 4: iii42 - V42/vi are chords built on scale degree 3, V65/ii on 6, ii7 on 2, V7 on 5, and then, of course, I on 1.  Heavy chromaticism on endings tends to obscure things, so if you want a nice, satisfying ending, it's often good to keep the ending more diatonic, especially if it contrasts with the preceding material.  (Interestingly enough, jazz tends to do the exact opposite, with a very non-diatonic chord as the final chord for effect.  Different ways to do things, huh?)</p>
<p class="text">Let's check out one of Bach's solutions to the same reharmonization problem, <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgBh6k56IYw">Chorale 363</a>:</p>

<? createExample('Chorale 363'); ?>

<p class="text">I'm not going to spend a whole lot of time going over each individual chord in this chorale, but you can see that Bach stuck a bit closer to the home key, not doing much chromaticism and mostly using the basic I's and V's.  I personally find this chorale rather unremarkable, for the most part.  A few sections ago, I might have pointed out how the iii chord is used: in measure 1, it goes to vi in a circle of fifths, and in measure 10 we have iii7 going to IV7.  There's nothing weird about either of those, but they're nice examples of the traditional use of iii chords.  We also have two nice modulated sections in the middle, corresponding to the cadences on B and D.  In measure 9, we have a iv6 - viio7 - i in Bm, which is the ii at that point in the music; that's a somewhat infrequent use of a secondary chord that is not a dominant.  In the land of motifs, there's a 16th note figure in the tenor going into 4, and it's interesting that the same six beats occur in the alto going into 8, just up a fourth.  In fact, it's even more interesting than that; measures 4 and 8 (plus the preceding beat in each case) have exactly the same music, except that the tenor and alto switch parts and measure 8 is a fourth higher (a fifth lower for the tenor).  The ending at 12 is similar to 4, but the bass has some more motion, probably to maintain the momentum from measure 11.</p>
<p class="text">My reharmonization was more adventurous, kinda because I did that completely on purpose.  Bach was much more conservative.  Mine started off-tonic (ha ha ha); Bach didn't want to do that.  Bach's is way less chromatic.  There's nothing wrong with that, by the way; I was deliberately trying to be as chromatic as possible within limits.  Bach might have had other goals, like trying to make good music.</p>
<h4 class="question">Good music, ha.  What a silly goal.</h4>
<p class="text">Exactly.  He was really hamstringing himself.  Meanwhile, let's check out another reharmonization of the same chorale melody, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MORa0Y98Z1o">Chorale 360</a> (go to 35:26 in the video):</p>

<? createExample('Chorale 360'); ?>

<p class="text">This chorale is in a different key, but it's otherwise the same melody... almost.  There are a few embellishments.  Generally, we don't touch the melody when we do a reharmonization, but Bach plays by his own rules, as we know.</p>
<p class="text">It's instructive to compare this harmonization to the other one we looked at just above in <? exampleLink('Chorale 363'); ?>.  It's <em>pretty much the same damn thing</em>.  The voicing is a bit different, but look, the first two measures have the same chords in both chorales!  Measure 3 is a little more different between them, but just barely, and measure 4 again has the same chords.  Measure 5 again modulates to the ii, but 363 has i6 - V84 - V73 - i (remember, V84 - V73 represents a suspension that resolves into a 7th chord), while 360 has bVI - iiø65 - V7 - i.  Two chords changed, wow!  The rest proceeds similarly, with a few small differences but nothing structural.</p>
<p class="text">Here is where I point out that chorales 361, 362, 364, and 365 <em>also</em> harmonize the same melody.  Of these six (including 360 and 363), only 361 doesn't have a bass starting 1 - 6 - 3.  I'm not going to waste my time analyzing each of these, but clearly they're pretty similar.  I'd say that these chorales are not among Bach's most harmonically inventive works, or even his most inventive chorales, for that matter.  He can be <em>very</em> adventurous when he wants to be, just, apparently, not here.</p>
<p class="text">In the spirit of that adventure, I present one more reharmonization, this time <em>not</em> in the style of Bach.  It's still a chorale, but we're going... further afield.  Here we go:</p>

<? createExample('Werde munter rereharmonization'); ?>

<h4 class="question">Oof.  Bach, that is not.</h4>
<p class="text">And just for some good old-fashioned S&G, the second recording is in 31-TET.</p>
<h4 class="question">Why the 31-TET?  Did Bach write in 31-TET?</h4>
<p class="text">...No, but 31-TET is actually fairly close to what he did use.  Even his famous Well-Tempered Clavier wasn't in equal temperament but in <em>well</em>-temperament, and 31-TET is fairly close to temperaments used around his time.  Some composers actually used it directly, believe it or not, but this is something for later.</p>
<p class="text">Now, I left this monstrosity un-analyzed, because most of it defies functional labels.  I tried to make sure chords were connected smoothly, but I didn't pay too much attention to the key.  I tried to have 9ths and #11ths and such, like when I harmonized a melody C# with a G major chord.  The first chord is an augmented 6th with a 9th in it.  That's pretty far out!  I also went further in my chromatic scale: the first four bars feature a complete chromatic scale downward in the bass, from Eb all the way down to C#, while the last four feature a complete chromatic scale upward in the alto, from G# all the way up to A (I repeated a note at the fermata because it would have been too ugly otherwise).  This is <em>not</em> Bach's harmonic language.  I could have gone crazier if I'd wanted to, by the way; I still wanted it to sound pretty, hence all the 9ths, but if I'd let that go out the window, the possibilities are, well, <em>less</em> interesting, I think.  You're welcome to disagree.  (By the way, measure 8 uses the whole tone scale.  That was not on purpose at first, but once I noticed it I left it in.)</p>
<p class="text">One very legitimate complaint about this reharmonization is that it's hard as fuck to sing.  Sure, the King's Singers could probably do it perfectly, but even professional singers would have difficulty with this chorale because of the chromaticism.  That said, while Bach wrote chorales for singers (some of the time), I didn't actually specify that <em>this</em> chorale is for singers.  It could well be an instrumental chorale.  You can be a lot more free with your voice leading in instrumental music than in vocal music, since it's easier to hit the notes without hearing it clearly.</p>
<p class="text">Now that you know what reharmonization is about, you might enjoy listening to some.  Music in the theme-and-variations form often relies on reharmonization to recontextualize a theme, especially a chorale melody or folk theme.  William Schuman did that with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4MMikzRROk">Chester</a>; the chorale plays first with traditional harmonies, then he gets modern, until the traditional harmony comes back at the end.  I hated playing this piece in high school, until I eventually understood what was going on, and it became one of my favorites by senior year or so.  Another great example, which I think I played once in a summer band but otherwise I'd just heard performed a whole bunch of times, is John Barnes Chance's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-AEzxkRWBA">Variations on a Korean Folk Song</a>, based on Arirang, which we saw back in <? exampleLink('Arirang'); ?>.  A more conservative set of reharmonizations can be found in Frank Ticheli's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ObU0tj526s">Amazing Grace</a>, a very pretty piece I played I think freshman year.  Finally, Jack Stamp reharmonized The Star-Spangled Banner in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vXJgJvUz30">A Love Song to Our Country</a> just a few days after 9/11 to symbolize American resolve in the face of deadly attacks — a sentiment similar to the scene at Fort McHenry that inspired Francis Scott Key to write the poem <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Star-Spangled_Banner">Defense of Fort M'Henry</a> that became our national anthem.  This is an interesting reharmonization, in my opinion, because it's not just presenting some creativity with harmony; the reharmonization serves a political purpose.  We'll get back to this idea quite soon.  Meanwhile, Dudley Buck took another tack entirely in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psav2QiJhgQ">Festival Overture</a>, another piece based on the Star-Spangled Banner.</p>
<p class="text">I'm going to show you two more pieces I arranged for my old a cappella group Techiya, singing Jewish/Hebrew/Israeli music.  The first one you've seen in <? exampleLink('YSZ'); ?>, Y'rushalayim Shel Zahav, by Naomi Shemer.  Here's the first performance in 1967 by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yR9KDduDVA">Shuli Natan</a>.  This version is particularly interesting because the second verse talks about Jerusalem sitting empty, and just a few weeks later, Israel was able to recover Jerusalem (after the Six-Day War) and Shemer rewrote the second verse.  The rewritten version is the one most people know today.  (There were some other changes too, like "the city that sits alone", a reference to the first verse of Lamentations, being changed to "the city that stands alone" after it was reclaimed, but for some reason that change didn't take.)  The melody of the verse of Y'rushalayim Shel Zahav was inspired by a Basque folk song called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttuRcl1dK1M">Pello Joxepe</a>, which Naomi Shemer chanced to hear performed in Israel, but our current subject matter is the chorus, not the verse.  The melody goes as follows (transposed to Em for my convenience later):</p>

<? createExample('YSZ melody'); ?>

<p class="text">As is the case with folk songs, usually the melody gets transmitted without the accompanying harmony, necessarily.  Sure, there was an original performance, but Shuli Natan made that performance hers, just as countless musicians have made their performances theirs by using the harmonies <em>they</em> hear in their heads, not the harmonies of someone else's performance.  Still, I wanted to give you a kind of harmonic baseline for this melody, which is why I sought out that 1967 performance, which I'd never heard before.  In searching for it, I first searched for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72QC8EGnxTw">famous Ofra Haza performance</a> that everyone seems to know, but since she was singing the updated second verse, I knew that wasn't the right one.  I added 1967 in my search and I understood why: the original performance was by Shuli Natan.  Ofra Haza was a <em>much</em> later singer, her famous performance being from 1998.  Whoops.  I did find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjmMllp8hJg">another Shuli Natan version</a> first.  Well, guess what?  The three versions here — the Shuli Natan first performance, the other Shuli Natan version, and the Ofra Haza live spectacular — all have different harmonies!  There are hundreds (not exaggerating) of other performances of this song, and I'm sure the harmony diverges in most cases.  So I'm not going to say that these different versions of the harmony are reharmonizations.  They're just different harmonizations.  I think that for it to be a true reharmonization, it has to depart significantly from the expected harmony.  It has to recontextualize something,  If it's a reasonable interpretation of the harmonic implications of the melody, it's just a plain harmonization.  Let's briefly look at the three harmonizations in the recordings I've linked, where by "briefly" I mean I'm just going to give you the Roman numerals for each:</p>

<? createExample('YSZ harmonies'); ?>

<p class="text">These three versions of the harmony are fairly similar, but not identical.  Everyone starts on the iv, because that part's really iconic.  I expected Shuli Natan to then go to the i in measure 2, like Ofra Haza does, but instead she takes that iv and turns it into a ii - V - I in the key of the bIII.  This took me by surprise because I wrote that in <em>my</em> version and I didn't know it was basically canon!  Shuli Natan must have stolen my harmonies FROM THE FUTURE!  I also expected measures 3 and 4 to be iv - i, but instead, everyone agrees on the bVI for measure 3, yet they don't repeat the ii - V - I from measures 1 and 2.  Natan goes to i (by means of a passing chord) in one performance and V in another, while Haza does a i with a very obvious suspended 9th.  All three go back to the bVI for measure 5 and to the bIII for measure 6 (Haza uses a passing V/bIII like Natan in measure 1).  Natan's first performance and Haza go to i for measure 7, and everyone arrives at i at measure 8, but only Natan's first and Haza have the passing V.  Why?  Because Natan's second performance goes to bVI6 instead of i (by means of a passing bVII6), and bVI6 is only one half step in one voice away from i, so a passing chord is less necessary.  Generally, all three versions hit the obvious implied harmonies, but they make different choices throughout these eight bars.</p>
<p class="text">Compare now my rendition:</p>

<? createExample('YSZ chorus 1'); ?>

<p class="text">In 2010, my old group Techiya was performing a concert at a big 85th birthday bash for the grandmother of one of the group members, where by "big birthday bash" I mean a catered lunch in a synagogue's event space with some large number of people.  Our performance (including the fact that her granddaughter was singing in it) was going to be a surprise.  Well, a week before the performance, as we were working out the details with the family member in charge of setting it up, and, well, he had a request: Y'rushalayim Shel Zahav, a favorite of the birthday girl.  Could we include that in our set list?  They even had the singer of a family member's band to sing the solo.  Ha, funny.  Obviously not.  That's clearly unfeasible; our group took months to learn new music, and they wanted something like this in a week?  We didn't even have an arrangement.  We had to tell him sorry, we can't possibly make that work.</p>
<p class="text">Except we did do that.  I wrote an arrangement over a day or so, I got together with the three other members of the group who could pull off the sightreading and we rehearsed until the wee hours of the morning, and this was the result.  It was quite successful; we later adopted it as one of our standard repertoire songs.  In 2014-2015, after I'd left Techiya and had joined the Honorable Menschen, we were asked to sing at someone's 90th birthday bash, again a catered lunch in a synagogue's event space (though this one was really just a co-opted regular Saturday morning kiddush).  Not the same person's, but you know.  Again, the person putting the performance together asked for Y'rushalayim Shel Zahav, a favorite of the birthday boy, and, again, we didn't have the piece ready.  But this time, I had already written an arrangement 4-5 years earlier, and we had enough notice that we could actually put it together.  It was also quite successful, and we added it to our regular repertoire and eventually even recorded it.  Turns out that, if you're a Jewish person of a certain age, you pretty much love this song.</p>
<p class="text">My arrangement is actually more of a tone poem, reflecting the text.  For example, at the beginning, there's a line translating to "carried by the evening winds and the sound of bells", and I had the alto and tenor make wind noises for a bit, then everyone cadences with some "dong dong dong" sounds for the bells.  Whole thing, really evocative.  I tried to be pretty creative with the verses, but not so much with the chorus.</p>
<p class="text">For years before I wrote this arrangement, one of my funtime activities was to sit at the piano and harmonize Y'rushalayim Shel Zahav (and Hatikvah, coming up).  It was just fun seeing which chords would work, how I could make it major or minor at will, stuff like that.  So, when I wrote the arrangement, I had already pretty much worked out a harmony.  Now, I learned this song in elementary school, but it was completely by ear from the teacher.  She would accompany us on her accordion and sing bits of the song for us to sing back.  I did <em>not</em> learn this from Shuli Natan or Ofra Haza, or really any recording.  I learned the melody along with everyone else in my class, and if there was any harmony, it was played by the teacher.  I couldn't tell you what she might have played, because I didn't remember it.  All I knew was what I worked out at the piano, and when I did the arrangement, I picked one of the possibilities I'd played around with.  I'd say, then, that this harmony is a bit more interesting than the implied harmony of the melody.  (There's also a difference in the melody: the second note of measure 6 should be a B, but for some reason, I'd remembered it differently from when I learned it as a kid.  I like it better my way!)</p>
<p class="text">My harmony does something the other three that we've seen don't: it hangs out in the relative major.  By measure 4, the other three are firmly back to the home key, with i's or V's, but my harmony is still in the new key and doesn't get back to the old key until the very end.  It does feature a minor v in the first ending, which is fairly normal in 20th century folk music, but it makes the cadence less final.  It's only at the second ending, when we want to lead back to the verses that are <em>actually</em> in E minor, that I do a traditional V - i.</p>
<p class="text">As I mentioned, the arrangement is a tone poem, and the third verse ends very powerfully: "For your name burns the lips like the kiss of a seraph, if I forget you, Jerusalem, which is all gold."  I thought that this burning ending needed some burning harmony to match (ha ha, get it, to <em>match</em>, because matches, get it?  No?  OK), so I switched from E minor to E phrygian dominant, a mode that's hinted at in the verse: the word that translates to "seraph" is on the raised 3 of the mode, not the b3.  I figured, hey, let's take this all the way, with E major chords and F major chords and maybe even G major chords.  So, there's a big "WHICH IS ALL GOLD!" ending to verse 3.  From there, this same chorus wouldn't cut it, now, would it?  I had to write a different final chorus: a <em>reharmonization</em>, if you will.  Here it is:</p>

<? createExample('YSZ chorus 3'); ?>

<h4 class="question">That sounds glorious!</h4>
<p class="text">That was the point!  Major chords in a minor key tend to have that glorious sound, and those major chords are usually bVI and bVII, possibly also bIII, and, going a bit out of key, IV, I, and bII.  Not V.  That's just dominant-sounding.  Notice how, at 2, I kept the i chord, because IV - I is simply major instead of a high-intensity minor.  The bII is probably the most major-sounding chord around, too.  Notice also that, unlike in the other chorus, this one doesn't modulate to G until the first cadence (7 and 8).  We've just come off of a high and very loud note at the end of verse 3, so when this excerpt starts, we're full of energy and we're in some sort of hybrid minor/phrygian dominant situation in E.  We want to actually expend that energy and have a climax, and that's the stretch from measure 1 to measure 6 or so.  Measures 2 and 4 have appoggiaturas, which always raise the emotional level of the music; the other chorus had them too, but they're bigger here.  Measure 6 has a #4 - 3 appoggiatura, and the #4 is <em>the</em> brightest note you can generally add on a major chord (note that the bII6#4 isn't a second-inversion triad; it just has suspensions).  By measures 7 and 8, though, we've come back down, landing in the calmer relative major.</p>
<p class="text">The mood completely changes for the last eight bars of the song, though.  The raw gloriousness of the end of verse 3 has been expended, and now we just want to have a quiet, emotional, meaningful ending, reflecting on all that we've sung so far.  So I turned my harmonization, which was at, say, 8 in the first half and 5 in the other choruses, down to 2.  Just iv's, V's, and i's here, for four bars.  Then we go out of time a little bit, for a fancy ending for the soloist.  The last two bars, I have to admit, I stole from another piece I'd recently arranged.  It's just your standard Mario cadence — bVI - bVII - I — but with an octave leap in the soprano; it's very emotional.  The cool (and coincidental) thing about that little octave leap is that I think it sounds like a violin, and the word the sopranos sing it on is "kinor", meaning violin.  The low E and high E should be connected, almost like a glissando or portamento, but much quicker.  It's a wonderful effect when you actually hear it sung.</p>
<p class="text">So let's see how I did this mechanically.  Each melody note can be the root, third, or fifth of a major or minor triad, as well as many other things besides.  We just ended on a big E major chord before this excerpt starts, so what makes the most sense for that A?  It could be the root of Am or A, the third of F or F#m, and the fifth of Dm or D, as well as the seventh of B7, Bm7, or BbM7, a note in a diminished or augmented chord, etc.  In the other choruses, this first note is the root of a iv chord, Am, but here we can chromatically alter it to be different but similar right off the bat and use IV, A major.  Second bar, G.  Could be G, Gm, Em, Eb, Cm, C, A7, Am7, AbM7, etc.  In the other choruses, I went with G (and added a secondary dominant beforehand), but resolving to the relative major is kind of boring.  On the other hand, Em helps establish the key <em>and</em> sounds special against the IV; we get a clear feeling of modal interchange.  The suspended 9th is, as I mentioned, a great way to ratchet the emotional impact (Ofra Haza does it as well, though I didn't know that at the time).  The C in measure 3 could be Cm, C, Am, Ab, Fm, F, D7, Dm7, DbM7, etc.  In the other choruses I went with C, but the context here is completely different, and I need to get to some sort of semi-arrival at measure 4.  I figured that using C again would create a mediant relationship (roots differ by a third) between the Em and the C; the bVI chord is the most "major-sounding" chord within the minor key because of that relationship.  In the other choruses, the C was actually the IV of G, which is not as interesting.  At 4, we have a B, which can be Bm, B, G#m, G, Em, E, C#7, C#m7, CM7, etc.  We've already had the impact of the iv - I, so I figured that now we could have a different modal mixture, bVI - I, which have a chromatic mediant relationship.  To get from bVI to I, there's no harm in a passing chord, and here I got a bit more creative and was able to fit a D9 chord to make a bVI - bVII - I Mario cadence with some extra color tones.  The arrival on the I is actually delayed about by the suspended third; you don't actually realize it's going to be major until the soprano gets there.  I figured that's another way to add more excitement.</p>
<p class="text">Measure 5, I just went with the same thing I'd already done, the bVI - bVII.  The other choruses also have the C major, but the soprano stays on G while the solo goes up to the high E.  Here, I put the soprano in thirds with the solo, changing the texture to emphasize the high voices in close harmony, so even though the harmony is the same as two bars earlier, it feels fresh.  Of course, having the same harmony in bar 5 as bar 3 creates the expectation that bar 6 will be similar to bar 4, <em>which it is not</em>.  I hear the melody in bar 6 as D C, with the D as an appoggiatura (or accented passing tone, whatever) to the C, which is the principal melody note.  Naomi Shemer seems to have written it D B, with both notes as chord tones, but, well, that's not how <em>I</em> grew up singing Y'rushalayim Shel Zahav!  So, how do I harmonize the C as... large as possible?  F major, and with the soprano in thirds with the solo, we even get that B in the soprano, creating a #4.  We expect bVI - bVII - I, but the listener is tricked since we go up a half step instead to bII instead of I.  There's a chromatic mediant here too, from the D major to the F major.  Measures 7 and 8, though, I want to get back down in intensity, and there's not much that's more boring as some simple V - I's, yet not in the home key because we don't really want to get there until measure 9.  After that, there's nothing really to say; it's just quiet and normal, with the accompaniment purposely much softer than the soloist to give the soloist space to be essentially alone with the audience.</p>
<p class="text">The reason I'm showing you this is to compare this chorus to the previous one.  Harmony can make a big difference, even within one melody.  New harmony can recontextualize a melody in a new way, and it can be used to paint emotions so long as you can still fit it to the melody somehow!  Even fitting it to the melody is not all that necessary if you're using a more dissonant harmonic language, and that's another way to approach the harmony.  What a reharmonization allows you to do is take a possibly familiar piece of music and give it new life with new meaning.</p>
<p class="text">Finally, I did another sort of creative reharmonization of an Israeli anthem, this time the official one, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatikvah">Hatikvah</a>.  The melody for Hatikvah is apparently Italian originally, from the 16th century, and it's been used for many folk songs throughout Europe.  Similar melodies have been popular in various parts of the Ashkenazic liturgy even before its use for Hatikvah was widely known.  We can therefore say that this melody has generally evolved organically and isn't the work of a single composer anymore.  Here's how that melody goes with Hatikvah in modern times:</p>

<? createExample('Hatikvah melody'); ?>

<p class="text">The tune is simple, with two-bar phrases and lots of repetition.  You can say that the tune has an AABBCC' structure (which I've labeled for you), and the A, A, C, and C' section all end with the same two-bar phrase (3-4, 7-8, 15-16, 19-20).  Normally, something like this — a national anthem — is harmonized pretty conservatively.  Stay diatonic (other than brief secondary dominants and such), lots of V's and i's, etc.  The A section might be harmonized with i at measure 1, iv - i at 2, iv - i at 3, and V - i at 4.  Simple, effective.</p>
<p class="text">But, while every Jewish soul yearns for our homeland, every Jewish soul also ought to be feeling pretty conflicted about what Israel does in the world.  Justify or rationalize it however you want, but Israel's prophesied role as a beacon to the nations is, to be diplomatic, not being fulfilled currently.  So, knowing about Jack Stamp's reharmonization of the Star-Spangled Banner that I mentioned a little while ago, I figured I'd try my hand at something similar for my old a cappella group Techiya.  The piece ended up not chosen to be in our repertoire because people were not interested in the concept of a harmonically ambiguous Hatikvah, saying that it would restrict performance possibilities, feel disrespectful, etc.  Those are valid points, even though that's not my view; they felt that, if we were to perform Hatikvah, we should perform a standard harmonization and make everyone stand up, while I felt that it worked on its own as a choral piece, within the tradition of modern (late 20th century) Jewish art.  So it never got performed.  Maybe you'll want to give it a try with your choral group (I can send you the complete arrangement if you'd like).</p>
<p class="text">The piece actually has two harmonizations of the melody; it goes through the whole thing twice.  This is the first one (you can hear both halves on my <a href="https://offtonic.com/music/other.php#hatikvah">music page</a>):</p>

<? createExample('Hatikvah reharmonization 1'); ?>

<p class="text">This harmony is dark and troubled, ethereal at times, and, especially in the second half (which is not part of this excerpt), very hopeful.  I think that should resonate with everyone in a different way.  All of us should feel troubled about Israel, whether you're troubled by what Israel is doing, what has been done to it, what it has not done, what others think (no matter which side you're on, you're always troubled by what the other side thinks), etc., but similarly, everyone should feel the magic and the hope, even if one person's hope might be completely different from another's.  I'd say that this harmonization <em>is</em> political, as much as Jack Stamp was political with his A Love Song to My Country, but it's not political in any particular direction.  Whatever your feelings are on the subject, I challenge you to find them in this harmonization.  Unlike Stamp's, though, this arrangement is abstract, not a tone poem.  Stamp worked a lot of contrast into setting up the line "but the flag was still there"; as you sing along, the meaning is unmistakable.  There's less of that here (modern Jewish art has loves this kind of stylized abstraction), except for the harmonization of the two B sections, which translate to "our hope still isn't gone, the hope that is 2000 years old".  You can't not hear a weariness in the first line and a twinge of hopeful sadness in the second — a troubled hope, but a hope nonetheless.  Well, maybe you <em>can</em> not hear it.  You can hear something completely different or even nothing at all.  I'm not inside your brain!  Unless you're me, proofreading this later.  Then I am inside your brain.  My brain.  Our brain.</p>
<p class="text">Let's go through it.  It was a lot of fun to write this arrangement, but it's also from a long time ago and I was less mature as an arranger; you can tell by how I overuse certain elements, how bad the voice leading is, etc.  On the other hand, it's also beautiful, so hey.  First five bars are a little introduction, setting the mood of the first harmonization.  Note the tempo: 54 BPM is <em>slow</em> (I marked it "Lento" in the original), much slower than the anthem is usually sung.  We start with some long notes, some dissonance that resolves, some major bits for contrast, and then a dissonant V7b9.  How did I come up with all this?  Eh, scale in the bass, throw some chords over it, boom, done.  A point of interest: the chord at measure 2 is a iiø7 (with a doubled 7th, blasphemy!) that resolves to i6.  You may think that this is weird, but if you think of it not as a iiø7 but as a i6 with an appoggiatura A in the alto and passing tone D# in the bass, it makes a little more sense.  Those two "non-harmonic" tones form a tritone that gets resolved the way tritones <em>should</em> get resolved, but it's not a V - i like you'd normally expect with a tritone.  One of the things you get to explore with slow music like this is what happens when you purposely have a sonority that clashes.  That's part of why this was so much fun.</p>
<p class="text">The melody starts in the alto at 6.  First two bars are basically the same as the intro; I'm deliberately keeping it as static as possible.  You might expect iv - i at measure 7, so the iiø7 - i6 feels darker as it features an independent melody in the bass (the scale).  The downbeat at 6 has no third, creating a feeling of space.  The harmony is pretty standard at 8 and 9, but note the 9ths.  There are gonna be <em>lots</em> of those.  Also note that 9 has no third either, but the directionality of the V chord is preserved by means of the 7th and 9th.</p>
<p class="text">At 10. the tenor joins the alto in the melody, singing parallel fifths, again with no third in the chord.</p>
<h4 class="question">Parallel fifths?  Aren't those bad?</h4>
<p class="text">They're possibly undesirable in a smooth voice-leading setting with independent voices because it's a strong effect that sticks out.  Here, though, I have these third-less chords already creating a quintal context — <em>quintal</em> meaning fifth-based</p> — so the effect of the parallel fifths is entirely desired.</p>
<p class="text">At measure 11 we have one of those great dissonances, the diminished octave (which sounds much less dissonant than its inversion, the augmented octave) between the B# in the bass and B in the soprano.  The B in the soprano resolves... badly.  Yeah.  I wouldn't have done this if I'd written this piece today.  It ends up on the 9th of the second chord, which is a quintal chord, C# G# D#, again, no third.  Quintal chords — chords built by stacking fifths — are a pain in the ass to tune, just so you know.  I did not know this at the time, but I know it now.  They're still nice to use on occasion, and if you can get a quintal chord to move in parallel, that creates a really nice effect too.  The major 9th becomes much less dissonant when there's a fifth below it as there is here.</p>
<p class="text">At 12, SURPRISE!  Major chords!  Parallel major chords, in open position (the notes are not all next to each other)!  And the bass drops out, too.  It's angelic and ethereal, and I love it.  Note that the tenor is still in parallel fifths with the alto melody, but the context has changed completely here thanks to the major thirds in the soprano.  The biting darkness of the minor third-less chords essentially gives way to a ray of heavenly light as the eye looks to Zion.</p>
<h4 class="question">Wait, minor third-less chords?  If it has no third, how can it be minor?</h4>
<p class="text">The great thing about chords is that you don't need all of the notes.  The chord C# C# G# C# at the end of 10 is not obviously major or minor, but if you also sing the first part of the measure, you'll hear all of the notes of the C# minor scale (some in the alto, some in the tenor), and that will tell you that the C# sonority that you're hearing — the "power chord", if you will, though power chords are specifically those played on distorted guitars — is part of a C# minor context and is therefore a C#m chord.  The notes that you <em>don't</em> hear are sometimes just as important as the ones you do hear.</p>
<p class="text">In measure 13, we again get that lovely B# - B dissonance, but it resolves more sanely this time.  Again, both V chords are very dissonant, one with a b10 and the other with a b9, and they resolve to the dark quintal tonic i chord we've just seen.</p>
<p class="text">Things start changing at 14.  The melody is now in the soprano, not the alto.  The downbeat is just octave and unison C#'s, but the starkness is broken by the i6, which is a softer minor chord; in measure 15 we have our now-usual B# - B dissonance again, but it resolves to a i chord that has a third in it.  We try the same at 16, but now the tenor has these heroic eighth notes, like a fanfare, and instead of a mild and reserved iiø7 on beat 3 we have the exuberant bVI, with its third relationship to the tonic; its exuberance is tempered, however, by the presence of the 7th.  Major 7th chords are melancholy, at least to me, because they combine a base major chord with a minor chord above it.  It's interesting, I think, because the minor 7th chord also combines the two modes (a base minor chord with a major chord above it), but the minor 7th feels more neutral, like the major and minor sort of cancel out, while the major 7th feels like it's both happy and sad at the same time.  That bVI7 chord is interpreted as a IV7/bIII, and we get our first cadence on something other than the tonic!  The lyric in measure 16, with the swell to forte, is "hatikvah", the hope, but the bright points — the bVI and bIII chords — both have major 7ths in them, and with the fall back to piano at 17, we can hear that in this hope there is no triumph.</p>
<p class="text">Hope is built on dreams, and this next section builds those dreams.  I didn't explicitly analyze a modulation here, but I provided some alternative explanations of the chords in the context of the key of E major, the bIII.  What's going on here is a fairly classic non-functional chord progression where stuff just becomes major and moves up; it's emblematic of music in soundtracks, similar to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69AyYUJUBTg">Zelda item fanfare</a>.  I really liked going from the E major at 17 to the B minor at 18, and from there, it's all major and up: C major, D major, E major, F#... something.  The soprano really helps out with the C major, because the soprano has an F#, the #4, which, as we've seen before, is the most "major" note you can put in a chord.  The melody is in the tenor now.  Measure 19, the D major and E major both have added 6ths.  I didn't think it made sense to analyze them as anything other than major triads with added 6ths.  I will say, though, that the Roman numerals are kinda besides the point right about now, which is why I'm not talking about them.  This progression is more about major chords going up than about anything functional in the key of C#m or E major.</p>
<p class="text">When we get to 20, the chord there is a combination of an F# chord (note that the bass from 18 has three whole steps in a row, C D E F#, a kind of no-no in Renaissance music that calls to mind the whole-tone scale) and a B chord.  It has F# and C# in the lower voices, which solidifies F# as the root, but then it has that B D# in the upper voices that makes it seem like a Badd9 chord.  I decided to analyze it as that Badd9, but do keep in mind that it's kind of both.  The F# is still in the bass, though, so the added note would be the 9th above the root but it's the 5th above the bass, hence add5 instead of add9.  What goes up comes down, so we keep the whole tone parallelism with the second chord at 20 (the bass has the melody now) that's just a step lower than the first, the suspension in the soprano notwithstanding.  All this whole-tone stuff feels ungrounded and non-functional, but the major chords are still bright; the feel overall is, I think, a kind of harsh brightness.  You're welcome to disagree, of course.  21 is just a normal cadence back to C#m, nothing special here (though I did write the V7b9 chord on the second beat as V43add5 because it was less confusing that way, and the i chord is again third-less).</p>
<p class="text">At 22, the melody is back in the alto, and we're done with the darkness and the harsh light for what I hear as a more personal, intimate hope.  The words at 18 are "lihyot am chofshi b'artzenu, eretz Tziyon Virushalayim", to be a free people in our land, the land of Zion and Jerusalem, and the four bars at 22 restate those words.  In a reharmonization, a repetition should generally be different from the original — not <em>just</em> in a reharmonization, obviously — and the contrast here is from these rising dreamlike major chords to a more homey diatonic progression... in E, not C#m.  We're in major now!  We can put some of that tumult behind us.  The second half of 22 is analyzed as I7 - vi6, but it's really a 7-6 suspension in the soprano.  The reason I didn't analyze it that way is because we do get the feeling of a V7 - I7 anyway.  In 23, there's a bit of a glorious tenor line with the high 9th on beat 3.  At 24, the soprano has a kind of dissonant pedal that casts a sheen over the progression, and that soprano B is why I analyzed the downbeat as IV13 instead of, I don't know, ii6 with an added 9th or something.  The chord is not entirely triadic.  We do get the opportunity for a sequence, though, since the melody goes F# F# E E; we can do something on beats 1 and 2 then repeat it a step lower.  The bass does this, A B G# A, while the soprano and tenor color it up by not making it a strict sequence.  Sequences are familiar and are a great way to make a piece of music sound more comfortable.  An attempt to continue the sequence at 25 leads to the cadence, the unison C#.  The cadence isn't a particularly powerful final cadence because, you'll recall, there's a whole second half of the piece that I didn't include here.  This ending ties up the first half, and the second half is faster and much less dark, with some real arrivals on major chords as opposed to the reserved major 7th chords we have here.  The ending is also really pretty.  You can listen to it on my <a href="https://offtonic.com/music/other.php#hatikvah">music page</a> if you'd like.</p>
<p class="text">So, this was another national anthem reharmonization, with purposes both political and artistic.  You certainly don't have to agree with the political opinions I presented in my interpretation of the harmony; I'm not even sure that I do.  I wrote it a long time ago, and I was more interested in making interesting music than in arguing Israeli politics.  That's still true today.  Well...  Kinda.  Still, my interpretation of the harmony is not any sort of "intended" interpretation.  I was definitely going for darkness at points and light at other points, but what the darkness and light might mean in the context of the Israeli anthem is really up to you to decide for yourself.</p>
<h4 class="question">Do you have any more hints for doing a reharmonization?</h4>
<p class="text">Hm.  Be clear about your harmonic language; if you change it, do so meaningfully.  What I mean is that you don't have to just use triads and 7th chords, and you don't even have to use functional harmony, but whatever you do, if something ends up sticking out because it's different, make sure that it sticks out because you <em>want</em> it to stick out.  When I was working on that chorale re-reharmonization above, for example, I ended up with some triads that I had to write out because none of the chords surrounding them were triads, and a clear harmony stuck out among the dissonances.  The same tends to happen in the other direction; if you only have triads and dominant 7ths, even an augmented 6th chord will pull you out of that space.</p>
<p class="text">The other piece of advice is that reharmonization is actually much easier than you might think.  Just start writing and coming up with alternative harmonies, and you'll have something that works soon enough.</p>
<p class="text">Now that we know how to parse harmonies, recognize them in melodies, and write our own harmonies, let's get to the stopping point of music: the cadence.</p>

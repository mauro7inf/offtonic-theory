<p class="text">This chapter is essentially the practical half of the previous chapter: now that we understand about intervals from a <em>theoretical</em> perspective, what do they <em>sound</em> like?  Ear training is the development of your ear (actually, your mind) to be able to match what you hear to what you see, and vice-versa.  For example, you know that D to A makes a P5, but do you know what that sounds like?  And if you heard a P5, would you recognize it as such?  I hope so, but we'll work on that in this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="question">So when I'm done reading this chapter I'll be able to identify all the intervals?</h4>
<p class="text">Actually...</p>
<h4 class="question">Don't tell me "it's complicated".</h4>
<p class="text">Sorry.  You're gonna have to actually do work here.  I know, it's a book on the internet, you're on the internet so that you can avoid doing work or whatever.  But no, you actually have to do work in order for the stuff in this chapter to make sense for you the way it's supposed to.  The nice part about that is that it hopefully won't be boring.  If you like music, anyway.  But if you didn't, why would you even care about learning theory?</p>
<p class="text">Before we start, do me a favor.  Without using a keyboard or other instrument, can you sing an F?</p>
<h4 class="question">Uh, NO.  (Or, YES.  I don't know.)</h4>
<p class="text">Most people can't.  That's OK.  This is a kind of superpower called <em>perfect pitch</em>.  When you have perfect pitch, when you hear notes, you can instantly tell what notes they are.  So if you hear some hum, you'll be able to tell that it's a Bb or whatever (fun fact: in the US, most electrical hums are somewhere between a Bb1 and a B1, which is 60 Hz).  Some people have this superpower, but it's not one that you can develop if you don't already have it.  I think speakers of tonal languages (meaning languages that use pitch to convey meaning) have a higher incidence of perfect pitch, so maybe it develops after a baby is born, but if you're old enough to read this, you're probably too old to develop perfect pitch.  Sorry.  I don't have perfect pitch either, but I hear it can actually be kind of a curse, because if you're singing with people and those people start going flat, you might stick out.  And, worse, you may learn the wrong notes for things.  Like, the note you learn is an E may actually be a little flat, so you have this wrong label in your mind.  Again, I don't have perfect pitch, so I don't know how it really works.</p>
<p class="text">The thing that ear training develops is <em>relative pitch</em>, the ability to correctly identify or produce intervals and scale degrees.  If you see a D and an A, maybe you don't know what that first note sounds like, but if I play a D for you, if you have good relative pitch, you'll be able to sing the A.  Relative pitch is incredibly important in music theory (so much so that perfect pitch may get in the way, if you have that particular ability).  Tuning forks work like this.  If you have <em>a</em> tuning fork, you can play one note, say, A4.  Then you can use relative pitch to figure out whatever note you actually need.  For example, if you need an E, you hit that tuning fork and head down a fourth.</p>
<p class="text">Of course, for that you'll have to be able to match pitches in the first place.  Hopefully you did this back in chapter 1.</p>
<h4 class="question">And what's absolute pitch?</h4>
<p class="text"><em>Absolute pitch</em> is mostly another name for perfect pitch, but people can disagree on this.  If I play an A then I play a perfect fifth above A, if you have relative pitch you can tell me that I played the second note a perfect fifth above the first note; if you have absolute pitch you can tell me that I played an A and E.  Perfect pitch is a <em>perceptual</em> ability you either have or don't have.  Absolute pitch can come from other sources, too.  For example, when I asked you to sing an F, I was able to do it.  I pulled out the <? appletLink('keyboard'); ?> and checked, and it was indeed an F that I sang.  I could have been wrong!  That's because I don't have perfect pitch; if I did, I would know if I was right or wrong.  Instead, I have a pretty good <em>pitch memory</em>.  I'm fairly good at remembering what pitches sound like simply because I use them so often, but I have to stop and think about it, and I can't have distractions.  Like, if I hear a note on its own, I may be able to tell you what it is within a whole step or so, but if there's other music going on I can't.  If I had perfect pitch, I'd be able to tell you what <em>all</em> of those notes were.</p>
<p class="text">So, before we dive in to the real ear training stuff, let's talk a little bit about how we hear and <em>what</em> we hear.</p>

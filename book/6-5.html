<p class="text">So, guy was playing piano at a bar.  Drunk dude comes up, says, "Hey, d'ya take, uh, requests?"  Pianist goes, "Sure, if I know it."  Drunk dude: "So can ya play, uh, a jazz chord?"  Pianist plays an Am7.  "That?"  Drunk dude gets annoyed.  "No, no, <em>a jazz chord</em>."  Pianist thinks for a bit, plays a complicated chord with extensions and alterations.  Drunk dude is still unhappy and loses his patience.  "NO, dumbass, <em>a jazz chord</em>!  You know...  a jazz chord... to say... I love ya!"</p>
<h4 class="question">That was not funny.  You suck at telling jokes.</h4>
<p class="text">...Fine.  You suck.  Just so you know.  I hate you.</p>
<p class="text">Anyway, jazz, starting in the so-called "bebop era" in the 1960's, started thinking of chords in a different way.  Before, chords in jazz were just like chords in pop: towers of thirds and extensions, possibly rearranged into nicer voicings.  But in jazz, you don't just play chords; you <em>improvise</em> over them.  So there was a revelation.  A G13 chord, for example, has 7 notes, right?  G B D F A C E.  You don't usually play them in that structure because that sounds terrible... but why not, then, play those chords... as a <em>scale</em>?  G A B C D E F.  It's the G mixolydian scale!</p>
<h4 class="question">...Mixolydian?  What?</h4>
<p class="text">We'll learn all about it in <? sectionLinkShort('modes'); ?> on modes.  For now, though, the important thing is that modern jazz thinks of chords not as a bunch of notes in a structure with a voicing but an entire 7-note scale (or maybe 5-note or 6-note or 8-note, depending), and a pianist or guitarist will choose to play some subset of those notes that he or she thinks is appropriate.  The chord symbols are deceptively simple, too, because something like CM7 would be C E G B in traditional theory, but in jazz, it's the entire C major scale.  Let's see how these work:</p>
<? createTableOfContents($label) ?>
<h3 class="subsection-title" id="major-scale-harmony">6.5.1 Major Scale Harmony</h3>
<? createExample('jazz chords major'); ?>
<p class="text">In jazz, if you see a CM7 (alternatively, C∆, which means the same thing), you don't just play C E G B and call it a chord.  Instead, you can play <em>all</em> of the notes of the C major scale however you want.</p>
<h4 class="question">But not the notes outside?</h4>
<p class="text">Well, you can play those too.  Nobody's stopping you.  Other than your bandmates, that is, because the chord symbol is an agreement between players, not an instruction from the heavens.  If you want you can play something different, but that would be a reharmonization.  Reharmonizations are awesome, but we're not talking about those right now.</p>
<p class="text">But the idea is that any of the notes in the scale will sound reasonably good.  Except, it turns out, the 4th, which I put in parentheses.  We've talked about that already.  The 4th is called an "avoid" note, which doesn't actually mean that you have to avoid it, but you should at least be aware that it doesn't sound so great most of the time.  In your soloing <em>or</em> your 'comping (that would be playing piano or guitar chords along with the ensemble), you're free to choose whatever notes you want in the scale without running into trouble.  You don't even need to play the root of the chord itself!  If you're a pianist or guitarist, that's called a <em>rootless voicing</em>.  If you're a bassist, that's called a federal crime and you're gonna be locked up, son.  When people talk about rootless voicings, they often forget to mention that <em>someone</em> is still playing the root, just not you.  Unless you're the bassist, in which case you are.  We'll see those later on.  I don't want to get too deep into jazz chords right now, just give an overview of what they are and how they work, but we've already seen some rootless chords, like the rootless V7b9 that's actually a viio7.</p>
<p class="text">The most used chords in jazz are the dorian chord (m7), used as a pre-dominant, the mixolydian chord (7), used as a dominant, and the ionian chord (M7), used as a tonic.  Interestingly, that doesn't mean that you <em>have</em> to use those scales on those chords, but they're the default.</p>
<p class="text">These chords all have one huge thing in common: they're all using the notes of the C major scale.  We call this <em>major scale harmony</em>.  If you're playing in C major, these are your diatonic chords, the chords in the key.  Most of the time, jazz doesn't stick to a single key, though.  Jazz pieces go all over the place.  We'll see that when we talk about minor scale harmony in just a bit.  This also means that the key signature is not so useful to figure out what notes to play over a given chord (if there even is one).  If you see a Dm7, you'll probably play the dorian chord in the C major key.  If you see an Fm7?  Dorian chord in the Eb major key.  A7?  Mixolydian chord in the E major key.  You may even get something like D7 - Db7 - CM7, where the D7 comes from G major, the Db7 comes from Ab melodic minor, and the CM7 comes from C major.</p>
<h4 class="question">Isn't Db7 from Gb major?  What's up with Ab melodic minor?</h4>
<p class="text">Oh, see, Db7 is obviously a tritone sub from G7, and tritone subs often have a #11.  I didn't mention that, but to a competent jazz musician I don't really need to spell everything out.  That chord is actually Db7#11, a chord we'll get to.  The truth is that both scales fit the chord symbol Db7, and which one you pick is up to you.</p>
<p class="text">Let's talk about each of these chords.  The ionian M7 chord is very often used as a major tonic, and the 11th is an avoid note.  We've already heard plenty of examples.  The dorian m7 chord is very often used as a pre-dominant, though it could also be a minor tonic.  It has no avoid notes.  The phrygian susb9 chord is a fairly mysterious-sounding chord (which we've heard before), and it's not used very often, especially not in tonal progressions.  It can be a iii in a iii - vi - ii - V - I, but usually it isn't.  The reason it's a susb9 is because the b3 doesn't play very well with the b9, as we've seen, so we use the 4 instead.  While most chords' principal notes are the root, third, fifth, and seventh, for sus chords they're the root, the second, the fourth, the fifth, and the seventh.</p>
<h4 class="question">Why not just m7?  The phrygian chord has the 1, b3, 5, and b7, right?</h4>
<p class="text">Yes.  But remember, chord symbols are meant to communicate.  In the phrygian chord, the b9 is actually important.  We'll soon see a different version of this chord, because the b6 is not technically an avoid note but it can often sound like one.</p>
<p class="text">The lydian M7#11 chord is a very popular chord, both as a IV (pre-dominant) chord and as a tonic.  We've seen plenty of examples of chords with #11.  The mixolydian 7 chord is a very often-used chord in dominant positions, and the 11th is an avoid note.</p>
<h4 class="question">Why is it an avoid note?  What about all those dominant 11th chords we've been seeing?</h4>
<p class="text">Well, really, sometimes the 11th sounds like an avoid note and sometimes not, depending on how you voice the chord.  That's why there's a second mixolydian chord, the sus chord.  When you see A7 or Asus, you'll play the same mixolydian chord in the key of D, but on an A7 the tritone between the 3 and b7 is important, while in the Asus the 4 is important, so you shouldn't put too much emphasis on the 3.  Note that we don't need to explicitly say the other notes.  In pop notation, a mixolydian chord in G might be labeled D11, while in jazz the same chord would be labeled simply Dsus (not even D7sus4).</p>
<p class="text">The aeolian m7b13 chord (or mb6) is actually used very infrequently, because the m6 sounds like an avoid note over the rest of the chord.  If you understand relative minors, this may be surprising, because isn't A minor the relative major of C major, so music in minor should generally use the aeolian chord?  The answer is no, and we'll see why in the next section.  The minor tonic is either the mM7 chord or the dorian m7 chord (which is sometimes written as m6).  You see the aeolian chord itself being used basically only when melodic considerations require the b6 over a minor chord, like in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye8KvYKn9-0">James Bond theme</a> by John Barry, in the second chord (when you have just one note moving against a static chord like that, it's called a <em>line cliché</em>).  By the way, the song ends in a nice mM7 chord; that chord is often called the Bond chord after this famous appearance!</p>
<p class="text">Finally, we have the locrian ø7 (or simply ø) chord.  This is usually a pre-dominant iiø in minor, as we've seen before, but in jazz we're more likely to use all 7 tones.  The ø chord has the 1, b3, b5, and b7, but the b2, 4, and b6 are not mentioned.  This means that the locrian scale is not the only possibility here, as we'll see shortly.</p>
<h4 class="question">So how do you... use these chords?</h4>
<p class="text">Well, a jazz composer (or editor) will write these chord symbols down, and the musicians will interpret them as they see fit when told to improvise over them.  Usually there's a written-out melody that someone will play, and the 'comping musicians will riff on the chords meanwhile.  But then the melody will stop and soloists in the ensemble will improvise over the changes.</p>
<h4 class="question">Changes?</h4>
<p class="text">That's just what we call the chord progression in jazz, the changes.  The improvisation consists mainly of noodling and playing licks and stuff in the scale that the chord symbol indicates.  So the sheet music may just have some slashes or whatever with the chord symbols written above.</p>
<p class="text">The real <em>chords</em> — more than one note at a time, the harmony, etc. — are not different from the chords with extensions that we spent a good long while talking about.  The only thing that's different is how we think about them.</p>
<p class="text">Anyway, major scale harmony is just part of the picture.  The other part is... cool:</p>
<h3 class="subsection-title" id="melodic-minor-scale-harmony">6.5.2 Melodic Minor Scale Harmony</h3>
<? createExample('jazz chords minor'); ?>
<p class="text">Just a warning, I can't get Sibelius to do it, but you might see the minor-major chord written as C<sup><u>∆</u></sup>, with the ∆ above the –.  That's the same as C–∆.  I personally find the whole – thing a little confusing, but that's what it is.</p>
<p class="text">So, melodic minor scale harmony.  You know how the minor key has three aspects, natural, harmonic, and melodic minor?  The natural minor is the notes of the key; harmonic minor is a modification to use V chords; melodic minor is a melodic modification to make going to the 7 smoother and therefore it mostly applies in ascending lines?  We'll review that in <? sectionLinkShort('modes'); ?> if not, but that's not important here.  Rather, jazz musicians like the sound of the ascending version of melodic minor as its own independent sound, not linked to a minor key, and this is where melodic minor scale harmony comes from in jazz.  This provides essentially a different solution to the problem of what notes to play over a chord.</p>
<h4 class="question">Why this particular scale?</h4>
<p class="text">The main requirements for jazz improvisation is that the music should be able to run smoothly from one note to another.  This is a problem when there are gaps in the scale.  The harmonic minor scale, for example, has an augmented second between the b6 and the 7, and that's just too wide.  There are only three seven-note scales possible with no augmented seconds, and they are the diatonic scale, the acoustic scale (also known as lydian dominant, which is the melodic minor scale starting from the fourth scale degree), and the whole tone scale with an extra note, which has two semitones in a row.  There's just one six-note scale with this requirement, the whole tone scale.  There are several eighth-note (octatonic) scales with this requirement, but only one without two semitones in a row, the diminished scale.  We'll talk about both of these in the next section.  Basically, the melodic minor scale is the only seven-note scale other than the diatonic scale with no augmented seconds and without two semitones in a row, and that's why it's suitable for jazz.</p>
<p class="text">Also it sounds cool.</p>
<p class="text">These chords are used in the same ways as their major scale cousins.  We've also already seen them as chords in the previous sections; we're just thinking about them differently here.  By the way, none of these chords has an avoid note at all!</p>
<p class="text">First, the minor-major chord is often used as a tonic in minor.  Not always, because the 7 is actually really dissonant against the b3 and the 5, though you can, of course, not play those notes.  The phrygian #6 chord is another choice for the susb9 chord we saw in the major scale section, the only difference being the 6th.  The b6 is kind of dissonant anyway, so you may just want to use the 6 here on susb9 chords (though there aren't many of them anyway).</p>
<h4 class="question">Why #6?  Isn't it a natural 6?  The #6 is enharmonically the same as the b7, right?</h4>
<p class="text">Ah, right.  This is confusing.  The phrygian scale has a b6 in it, so when we want to raise it, we write #6 to raise the 6th degree.  That's not the same as writing #6 in a chord symbol.  We're raising the 6th of the scale here, not adding a #6.  Yeah, it really is confusing.  The same is true of the locrian #2; the locrian scale normally has a b2, so locrian #2 goes 1 2 b3 4 b5 instead of 1 b2 b3 4 b5.  Another great scale is phrygian #3, which goes 1 b2 3 instead of 1 b2 b3.  We'll talk about this one in <? sectionLinkShort('modes'); ?>; it's one of my favorites.</p>
<p class="text">The next chord is the ∆#5 or +∆, the lydian augmented chord.  Note that the #11 isn't even mentioned.  Why?  Because with a #5, the 11 must be #11 otherwise you get an augmented second.  We've seen this chord before; it doesn't have some special function it's suitable for, but you can use its sound wherever you see fit.  It's lydian augmented because it's the lydian scale (1 2 3 #4 5 6 7) with an augmented triad on the tonic (1 3 #5), making it 1 2 3 #4 #5 6 7.</p>
<p class="text">Then we have the lydian dominant chord, the 7#11.  We've seen that a bunch of times already.  It's useful as a dominant, especially when it's a bII dominant like we saw earlier.  It's lydian dominant because it's the lydian scale (1 2 3 #4 5 6 7) with a dominant seventh on the tonic (1 3 5 b7), making it 1 2 3 #4 5 6 b7.  This scale is also known as the <em>acoustic scale</em> because the #11 is similar to the 11th overtone and the b7 is similar to the 7th overtone.  They're actually not that similar, but that's the name people use.</p>
<p class="text">The mixolydian b6 chord isn't really used, so it doesn't have a real symbol.  It has a b6 that sounds kind of avoid-y.  When it's played, it's just an inversion of the mM7.  The locrian #2 chord is another option for the extensions on a half-diminished chord.  We saw the locrian chord in the previous section; if you vary the second degree, you can get a different sound.</p>
<p class="text">The altered chord is a really weird one, and I've already explained it earlier.  If you look at the altered scale, it goes 1 b2 b3 b4 b5 b6 b7, a scale known as <em>superlocrian</em>.  The scale has a b4, which sounds like a 3, so we say that this scale actually goes with a dominant chord!  Enharmonically, the altered scale goes 1 b9 #9 3 #11/b5 #5/b13 b7.  This makes the chord symbol for B7alt B7b9#9#11b13.  That's crazy!  So the symbol is just B7alt.  Much easier, right?  We've seen altered chords already, but really, any 7#9 chord would normally be considered an alt chord.  You don't <em>have</em> to play the altered scale on a #9; there are some octatonic scales that would work as well.  For example, if your 7#9 chord has a 5 in it, you could play 1 b2 b3 3 #4 5 b6 b7.  Or you could play the diminished scale that we'll talk about in a minute.  The altered scale is also called the diminished whole tone scale because the first half of it is like the diminished scale and the second half is like the whole tone scale.</p>
<p class="text">A common ii - V - i in minor might go Dø - G7alt - C–∆.  It's important to note that these chords all have different keys attached.  Dø is either locrian in the key of Eb major (D Eb F G Ab Bb C) or locrian #2 in the key of F melodic minor (D E F G Ab Bb C); G7alt is the altered chord in Ab melodic minor (G Ab Bb B Db Eb F); C–∆ is the C melodic minor scale (C D Eb F G A B).  Usually, we think of keys as being what the entire piece is written in, but in jazz, it's usually better to think of the chords as coming from particular keys, even though they really don't.  We're playing in C minor, but the chords "come from" F melodic minor, Ab melodic minor, and C melodic minor.</p>
<h4 class="question">Why do the chords "come from" scales at all?  I don't see why this is important.  Why can't we just use chromatic notes like before?</h4>
<p class="text">Great question.  The answer is simple: it's easier to think in terms of keys than it is to memorize 14 different scales or however many.  As an improv musician, you need to take shortcuts where you can, because you need to be thinking on your feet to improvise over quick chord changes.  When you're composing at your leisure, it's still useful to consider the other notes of the scale of your chords, and thinking of them this way allows you to think of sets of notes more easily.  Thinking of chords as scales, especially as rearrangements of major or melodic minor scales, is nothing but a shortcut, but it's a very useful shortcut and it can save you a lot of time and effort.</p>
<p class="text">An interesting bit of information about melodic minor is that, with no avoid notes, any figure or voicing can sound like it fits over any root in the same scale.  This includes leaving out the third or seventh of different chords.  We would usually analyze these from a classical or pop perspective as slash chords or just something else, but in jazz, basically anything goes.</p>
<p class="text">There are a couple of other commonly-used chord scales:</p>
<h3 class="subsection-title" id="symmetric-scale-harmony">6.5.3 Symmetric Scale Harmony</h3>
<? createExample('jazz chords symmetric'); ?>
<h4 class="question">I'm counting wrong.  These scales don't have seven notes.  Right?</h4>
<p class="text">Your eyes aren't deceiving you.  The first two chords have eight notes and the third has six.  These are the other scales mentioned above that have no augmented seconds or consecutive semitones.  There are actually only two scales here; the second is the same as the first but starting on the second note.  There are three diminished scales in total and two whole tone scales.  Why?  Because they're symmetric!  Look at the first scale.  The pattern is that it goes up a half step, up a whole step, up a half step, a whole step, etc.: HWHWHWHW.  If you start this pattern on the second note, you get the second scale: up a whole step, up a half step, etc.: WHWHWHWH.  These two scales with eight notes are known as <em>octatonic</em> scales, and because their pattern repeats, they're also <em>symmetric</em> scales.  There are only three of them: one on C, one on Db, and one on D.  Why?  Because the one on Eb is actually the same as the one on C, the one on E is the same as the one on Db, etc.  The third scale, the whole tone scale, has only whole tones.  It has six notes, so it's <em>hexatonic</em>.  There are only two of them, one on C and one on Db, since the one on D is the same as the one on C.  We'll talk more about the scales themselves in the next chapter.</p>
<p class="text">But these scales are also chords.  You don't usually want to play all the notes, though!  That sounds ugly!  But you can pick some convenient subset.  The first scale is the most interesting, because, as you can see, it has a dominant chord.  If I were to write it out completely, it would be C13b9#9#11, but in jazz we'd just write it C7b9, or, if we really want that dissonance, C7#9.  We've seen both of these chords plenty already.  But hopefully we can see that it's actually very similar to the altered chord.  C7alt would be C7b9#9#11b13, with no fifth.  The difference is that the half-step/whole-step diminished scale has a 5 and a 13 while the altered scale has a b13 (or #5).  This is why the altered scale is also called the diminished whole tone scale: it has 1 b9 #9 3 #11 like the diminished scale, and it has #4 #5 b7 like the whole tone scale.  It's like a centaur, with the lower body of a diminished scale and the upper body of a whole tone scale.</p>
<p class="text">If you just see a diminished 7th chord, the second diminished scale here, the whole-step/half-step diminished scale, is more agreeable.  Why?  Because the 3, the 5, and the b7 get in the way.  The diminished 7th chord feels rootless, as we've mentioned before, but with a 3 or 5, it's no longer rootless, and now things clash.  The 7b9 chord is a great chord that contains a diminished 7th inside it but has a root, while the dim7 chord feels different.</p>
<p class="text">It's also worth noting: there are three diminished 7th chords, right?  The four-note kind?  Each diminished scale consists of two of them.  And of the four augmented triads, each whole tone scale consists of two of those.  The whole tone scale can also be called the augmented scale, and it fits an augmented dominant 7th chord.  It's also rootless, but the major third helps make it less so.</p>
<p class="text">These symmetric scales have some advantages and disadvantages.  The main advantage is that any lick or chord you play in one of them can be repeated a minor third up or down (for the diminished scales) or a whole step up or down (for the whole tone scale) and it will fit just as nicely.  The main disadvantage is that this gets boring, especially for the whole tone scale, since it only has one interval!  Every note on the whole tone scale sounds like every other note, and we might as well be doing cosmology!</p>
<h4 class="question">Am I supposed to get that reference?</h4>
<p class="text">Um, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_principle">maybe</a>?</p>
<p class="text">We'll get into what these scales actually sound like in the next chapter, but for now, it's good to be aware of them and how they can be played as jazz chords.</p>
<p class="text">Speaking of which, that's actually it for jazz chords.  You can come up with other scales and use them however you want, but in the language of jazz, this is what's done.  The possibilities actually open up a lot if you want to do jazz in tunings with more than 12 notes per octave.  We'll talk about that... at some point?</p>

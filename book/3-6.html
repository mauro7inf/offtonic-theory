			<h2 class="section-title" id="part-assignments">3.6 Part Assignments</h2>
			<p class="text">There are a few more written instructions that are fairly common: assigning who plays what.  One big one is when a part is marked <em>solo</em>, meaning "alone".  A solo is something played by just one person as a featured part.  If there's a spotlight, that spotlight is shining on that person with the solo.  On instrumental parts, usually multiple people are playing each part together, so the marking for the end of the solo is <em>tutti</em>, meaning "all", since everyone comes back in at that point.  If the soloist has freedom to change tempo, the rest of the ensemble might have <em>colla parte</em> (or <em>colla voce</em> if the soloist is a singer), meaning "with the soloist", an instruction to follow the soloist's tempo.  A not-quite-solo might say <em>a 2</em> or <em>a due</em>, where two people playing together play a featured part.  When an entire instrumental section plays a featured part, that may be marked <em>soli</em>, but it usually isn't.</p>
			<h4 class="question">What's a featured part?</h4>
			<p class="text">It's difficult to explain...  All parts are pretty important.  Say you have an orchestra.  Everyone's important.  But some parts are just filling in notes in the harmony, while other parts that are <em>usually</em> just filling out notes in the harmony have some big melody instead.  Like, you have a crowd murmuring, and then one dude stands up and says something and everyone hears.  That's a featured part.</p>
			<h4 class="question">What's the point of having just one person on a featured part instead of everybody?</h4>
			<p class="text">Good question!  It could be to feature that one person.  You want to show off your drummer, so you have everyone else shut up for a while so that the drummer can do a drum solo.  It could also be because a melody sounds prettier with just one person than with many.  A single person can exaggerate dynamics and expressivity and even intonation, while two people or more will never agree exactly.  It's just a different sound, and it gives the soloist a chance to be more expressive.  Sometimes, though, the composer wants the sound of one person on a non-featured part.  It may still be marked <em>solo</em>, but it's common to mark that <em>one only</em> instead to indicate that, even though it should be only one player, it's not a featured part.</p>
			<h4 class="question">How do you decide who plays a solo in a section?  Like, if there's a violin solo, who plays it?</h4>
			<p class="text">You asked a political question.  Generally a group will have some sort of audition procedure to determine the ranking of the players.  The best player will be first chair (or first desk), the section leader.  The next best will be second chair; the next best will be third chair, etc.  The first chair automatically gets the solos unless there's some switching around involved, which many groups do.  There may even be auditions, especially in choral groups.  By the way, in an orchestra, the first chair violinist is called the <em>concertmaster</em> (or <em>concertmistress</em>), and he or she is responsible for tuning the orchestra and shaking the conductor's hand after a concert (it's a sweet gig if you can get it).  In a wind orchestra, the concertmaster may be a first chair clarinetist or oboist, if one exists at all.</p>
			<p class="text">In an orchestral or choral setting, there may be a time when the composer needs more notes than there are parts.  For example, the composer may need four clarinet notes at one point but there are only three clarinet parts.  What to do?  Answer: a <em>divisi</em> (<em>div.</em>).  This is an instruction to the section to divide itself to cover the notes, usually half and half if there are two notes, but there could be more.  A <em>unison</em> (<em>unis.</em>) will bring the players back to the same part.</p>
			<p class="text">Totally unrelated: <em>segue</em> is written on music in two cases.  The first is at the end of a movement, when the next movement starts right away with no break; this is also often written <em>attacca</em>.  Beethoven does this in his <a href="http://imslp.org/wiki/Symphony_No.6,_Op.68_(Beethoven,_Ludwig_van)">6th symphony</a>, where it just goes from one movement to the next without a pause.  The other case is at the end of a page, where there's material on the next page to be played immediately on the page turn.  The <em>nice</em> thing to do on page turns is give the player some rests in which to do it.  Not every publisher is nice.  Sibelius actually puts a little set of glasses next to the music at that point automatically, which is the universal symbol for "don't fuck this up".</p>
			<p class="text">Finally, here's something kind of uncategorized:</p>
			<img class="example" src="../png/3/10.png" title="Tiny li'l notes!" alt="Example 3.10" width="800"/>
			<p class="caption">Example 3.10</p>
			<p class="text">Those are cues.  Specifically, this is a trumpet part, but during those rests in measures 2 and 3, the trombone has some other stuff.  The trumpet player doesn't actually have to do anything there; the cues are just there to help him follow the music.  Actually, sometimes an important solo will be written out as cues in another part; that way, if the ensemble is missing the soloist, someone else can play the part on a different instrument.  In Example 3.10, if the ensemble has a trumpet but not a trombone, the trumpet can fill in for the trombone in that little melody.  Note that sometimes composers make notes small for other reasons and you're still supposed to play them.</p>
			<h4 class="question">Cues?  Ha.  You don't know how to spell.  It's "queue".  Loser.</h4>
			<p class="text">NO, "cue" and "queue" are different words, dumbass.  A cue is a signal — for example, if you know you go onstage when someone on the stage says "fuzzy pickles" in dialogue, that's your <em>cue</em>.  When the conductor looks at you for a cymbal crash, that's a cue.  When notes are written tiny to show you someone else's part, that's a cue.  A queue is a first-in-first-out data structure, like the line you used to wait on to buy tickets at the movie theater before you started doing it all online.  Yeah, "cue" and "queue" sound the same, but they're different.  Stop overcorrecting shit.</p>
			<h4 class="question">Huh.  You're right.  I'm sorry!  I'll never make that mistake again!</h4>
			<p class="text">Thank you.  In music, spelling matters!  Though most of the time it's easier than in English.  Most of the time.  We'll talk about that much more in coming chapters.</p>

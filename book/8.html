<p class="text">Music theory deals with the content of music, so the form of the music itself often gets left out.  In this chapter we're going to talk a bit about the creative process and some of these considerations that are somewhat extrinsic to the music itself.</p>
<h4 class="question">What even is composition?  How is that different from producing or songwriting?</h4>
<p class="text">Usually, if you say you're a composer, people immediately assume you're a <em>classical</em> composer, composing <em>Western art music</em>.  When we use the term "classical music" in general, we're usually not talking about music specifically from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_period_(music)">Classical period</a> (from the death of J. S. Bach in 1750 to about 1815, featuring composers like Haydn and Mozart, though different people give different dates).  Instead, we mean this way of dealing with music that's specific to the Western art tradition.  We'll talk about that.</p>
<p class="text">However, in this chapter we're going to talk about creating music in general, no matter what type or genre.  People often say they <em>produce</em> EDM (<em>Electronic Dance Music</em>) when they create it.  When they write a pop-style song with lyrics, they often call themselves <em>songwriters</em>.  In all of these cases, composition is happening.  Composition is even happening when a musician improvises a solo or jams along with a band.  When a composer takes an existing composition and changes the details, adding features and such, to make an arrangement, that's composition.  When a DJ remixes a track, that's composition.  When a guitar player picks the position in which to play the given chords for a song, that's composition.  Any time new music is being dreamed up, the process is composition.</p>
<h4 class="question">What about when a baby starts whacking at the keys of a piano?</h4>
<p class="text">I think you'd have to ask the baby!  But this takes us back to the <? sectionLinkShort('intro'); ?> when we asked what music is in the first place.  Music requires intentionality.  If the thing you're creating is indeed music, then you are composing.  Still, it's good to check the corner cases, right?</p>
<p class="text">One big disclaimer: I'm not going to teach you what to compose.  That just can't be taught in a book.  Composition is an inherently creative act.  Music theory helps you figure out <em>how</em> to compose, but the actual thing you compose has to be what <em>you</em> create.</p>
<p class="text">So let's get to it.  This chapter is going to be mostly talk-based, but I'll try to have examples where I can.  I'm generally assuming that you have some interest in learning how composition works, no matter what your background is, or you probably wouldn't be reading this book!</p>

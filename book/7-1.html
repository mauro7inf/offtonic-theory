<p class="text">Hm.  This is a difficult question.  There are a lot of different meanings for both of these terms, and these meanings get all confused with each other.  I'm going to start with mode.</p>
<p class="text">A mode is simply a way of doing something.  If you're going someplace, you have to take a mode of transportation, a specific way of getting from one place to another such as walking, sailing, driving a car, riding a donkey, etc.  An appliance can be in the on mode, where it's running, or the off mode, where it's not, or possibly standby mode, where it's wasting electricity but not doing anything useful.  Modes are a very general concept, even though it's a bit difficult to put it in words.</p>
<p class="text">When it comes to music, the word "mode" usually takes on some more specific meanings, depending on the genre of music.  It refers to some kind of pattern employed by the music.  Some cultures have rhythmic modes, where a piece may have a particular beat pattern.  If you look back at Example 1.21, Lamah Haketz Nistam Na, the piece has a specific rhythm.  The basic unit is a bar of 3/4, a bar of 4/4, and a bar of 3/4, and from the pickup, the beats go 3 1, 3 1, 3 4 1, and they repeat like this.  Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE8cHyjCNLE">version in Arabic</a>.  This could be considered a <em>rhythmic mode</em>, in particular, this one is called <a href="http://www.maqamworld.com/rhythms/muwashahat2.html#samai_thaqil">samai thaqil</a> (though the samai thaqil mode is actually a bit different, so you could consider it a variant of samai thaqil).</p>
<p class="text">The piece also uses a certain set of notes, a scale that goes 1 2 b3 4 5 b6 b7, where the b7 is often raised.  In Arabic, music that uses this pattern of notes is said to be in a mode called <a href="http://www.maqamworld.com/maqamat/nahawand.html">maqam Nahwand</a>.  (We have a name for it in Western music, too: we call it the minor mode!)  <em>Maqam</em>, plural <em>maqamat</em>, means "place" in Arabic (similar to the Hebrew "makom"), and it's a more complicated concept than simply the notes used.  There are ways in which music that strictly adheres to the specific maqam are supposed to develop, notes that are supposed to be emphasized or deemphasized, whether it starts high or low, whether it ends high or low, whether it goes from 1 to 1 or from 5 to 5, stuff like that, it's all part of what makes a maqam.</p>
<p class="text">The modes this chapter is going to discuss are similar to the maqamat, not to rhythmic modes, but we'll talk about them more generally.  We're going to talk about the notes used in different modes and how to recognize these modes.  A set of notes used in a mode is called a <em>scale</em>.  In Western music, we don't stick to modal patterns much (or at all, really), so we use "mode" and "scale" sort of interchangeably, but "scale" generally refers to a set of notes without regard for how it's used, while "mode" refers to a specific way of using notes.  As an example, you could say that (in Western music) the natural minor, harmonic minor, and melodic minor <em>scales</em> are used in the minor <em>mode</em> in different ways.  But, again, we're not too strict about this stuff.</p>
<p class="text">The word "mode" has another meaning, and you'll soon see why it stuck.  The nth <em>mode</em> of a scale is the resulting scale type that you get when you start the scale at the nth note.  For example, the C major scale is C D E F G A B.  If you start the scale at the 6th note, A, you get A B C D E F G, the A natural minor scale.  We can say that the 6th mode of C major is A natural minor.  This will be a very useful concept because it shows how we can derive scales from other scales.</p>
<p class="text">A third use of the word "mode" is in jazz, where it refers to a chord.  I deliberately avoided using the word "mode" last chapter to describe jazz chords, and that's because people on the internet do it all the time and it pisses me off.  If you see a Dm7 chord in jazz, which we call the dorian chord, you'll want to play D E F G A B C, which is the dorian scale (or the dorian mode, the second mode of C major).  But that's not really the dorian mode.  That's just a dorian chord.  You're still playing C major.  The distinction may not be clear yet, but don't worry, we'll get there.</p>
<p class="text">To complicate things further, there's a real sense in which a harmony is actually a scale, even outside of jazz, and when you play a different chord, you're doing a mini-modulation to the harmony of that chord and changing the stability patterns of the scale you were in before.  That's basically what jazz chords are all about, but this concept has been used in classical music for over a century, with chords as horizontal structures rather than purely vertical.</p>
<p class="text">So, to sum up:</p>
<dl class="definitions">
	<dt><em>Scale</em></dt>
	<dd>Which notes are used.</dd>
	<dt><em>Mode</em></dt>
	<dd>Which notes/scales are used <em>and</em> how they function relative to each other.</dd>
	<dt><em>nth mode of a scale</em></dt>
	<dd>A new scale created by taking the notes of the given scale and beginning the scale at the nth degree.</dd>
</dl>
<h4 class="question">What about keys?  Isn't a key a thing too?</h4>
<p class="text">Aw, fuck.  Yeah.  Keys.  All right, so, I'm not a prescriptivist.  Usually.  I'll get annoyed if you misspell things that you shouldn't misspell ("que" is a word in Spanish and other Romance languages; it is <em>not</em> a cue or a queue, and those are two different things), but when it comes to using words, I recognize that people use them differently and incompatibly.  But keys just don't make much sense.  The Harvard Dictionary of Music defines a key as consisting of a tonic (say, E) and a mode (say, major, as in the key of E major), but really only major and minor count as modes here and a lot of people don't even realize that major and minor are modes at all.  There is no such thing as "the <em>key</em> of D in maqam Siga" or "the <em>key</em> of F mixolydian" (maqam Siga and mixolydian are modes, clearly), though you can certainly play in maqam Siga on D or in F mixolydian.  They're just not referred to as keys.  What are they?  Ehhh.  Unclear.  I don't like saying that the mode is F mixolydian, because the mode is just mixolydian; it just happens to be mixolydian centered on F.  It uses the scale of F mixolydian, but a piece can't be <em>in</em> a scale.  It can <em>use</em> a scale.  (By the way, modes can certainly use multiple scales.  Most of the ones we'll come across don't, but the definition of mode is very loose.)</p>
<p class="text">So what I generally do with keys is that I just declare some key that makes sense.  For example, suppose I'm writing a piece in F mixolydian.  That's F G A Bb C D Eb (I'll explain in a little while).  But the tonic is F, and the scale is similar enough to F major, so I'll just say that we're in the key of F major and generally ignore the fact that the mode is actually mixolydian because major is close enough.</p>
<p class="text">One more thing.  I mentioned F as a tonic, but modes don't <em>need</em> to have tonics.  The tonic is just one form of organizing notes.  In fact, I'd argue that the maqam Siga I mentioned doesn't have one.  The tonic is the center of gravity of a piece, the point of stability.  But some modes don't have a note that feels like the center of gravity; the music simply proceeds according to other rules or patterns.  Music that does contain a tonic is said to be <em>tonal</em>; music that behaves according to a mode that does not have a tonic is said to be <em>modal</em>.  (Don't confuse this with modal jazz, which is jazz that uses chord-scales like we saw in the last chapter; jazz players call those chords "modes", but they're really chords, so don't get confused.  OK, it's actually not a clear distinction.  But still.)</p>
<p class="text">This tonal/modal distinction is a bit complicated because the world of tonal music really only includes major and minor, so music that's in a mode other than major or minor and yet has a tonic is kind of lumped into the "other stuff" category by some theorists.  Well, not this one.  We use a broader notion of tonality called <em>extended tonality</em>, and this allows us to have tonal function in modes other than major and minor.  Since there's still tonal function, it's not appropriate to call music in these other modes "modal".  So, while some may argue that our imaginary piece in F mixolydian is not tonal, we're saying that it is, and that modal music is another thing entirely.</p>
<h4 class="question">Can we see some examples?</h4>
<p class="text">Oh God yes.  But first we're going to need to develop some vocabulary to understand the modes themselves, so let's start simple.  Actually, before that, I have something to show you that you'll be able to use throughout this chapter:</p>

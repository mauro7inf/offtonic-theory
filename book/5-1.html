<p class="text">By "a little bit" I mean "a lot".  It was supposed to be a brief digression, but the toys are just too cool, so it's not that brief.  But it's important in order to understand the intervals we'll be listening to.</p>
<h3 class="subsection-title" id="sound-waves">5.1.1 Sound Waves</h3>
<p class="text">Just to warn you, there will be a little math.</p>
<h4 class="question">...Warn?  Why do you need to warn me about math?  I may be a music n00b, but I'm not innumerate.</h4>
<p class="text">Well, you know, some people are actually afraid of math.  They see numbers and they immediately get lost.</p>
<h4 class="question">That's ridiculous.  But OK, I see your point.  Whatever.  Yalla, let's do math.</h4>
<p class="text">So what is sound?  We'll talk more about this later, but it's nothing more than stuff vibrating really quickly.</p>
<h4 class="question">How quickly?  And what stuff?</h4>
<p class="text">Depending on your age, between 20 and 20,000 times per second.  If you're younger, you can actually hear faster vibrations, but you lose that ability as you get older.  The stuff is usually air, but water can carry sound as well, as can anything else.  Your bones carry sound.  A metal handrail carries sound (try putting your ear on one end of a really long metal rod of some sort and have someone else gently flick the other end).  Whatever the thing that's vibrating, it gets to your ears and makes stuff vibrate there.  (That's why there's no sound in a vacuum — there's nothing there to vibrate.)  Your computer speakers, for example, have a membrane that moves in and out; by doing that, it pushes the air in front of it, making that air vibrate, and when those vibrations reach your ears, your eardrums and your ear bones and your ear cilia vibrate.  Your auditory nerve takes that information to your brain, and your brain processes those vibrations as <em>sound</em>.</p>
<h4 class="question">So if a tree falls in the forest and nobody is there to hear it, does it make a sound?</h4>
<p class="text">No, it does not.  Sound is your body's <em>interpretation</em> of the vibrations it feels.  In that sense, it's like color.  This medicine bottle in front of me is not orange.  The photons hitting my eye from its direction have various energies, and the color-sensing cells in my eyes fire in such a way that my brain interprets the signal as the color which I've named "orange".  The photons, the light waves, those are there regardless of whether I'm in the room.  But the <em>color</em> is something my brain makes up in order to understand the stimuli from those photons.  It's similar with sound; it's how the brain interprets vibrations.</p>
<p class="text">Anyway, if those vibrations are regular enough, we can say that they have a <em>frequency</em>, usually measured in vibrations per second, also known as <em>Hertz</em> (Hz).  A wave at 440 Hz, for example, vibrates at 440 vibrations per second.  Here's an example of a wave called a sine wave (horizontal axis is time; vertical axis is displacement):</p>
<canvas id="sineexample" class="keyboard" height="200" width="800"></canvas>
<p class="caption">Example 5.1</p>
<h4 class="question">What does that sound like?</h4>
<p class="text">Good question.  Sounds like this (try numbers like 440):</p>
<div id="tonegenerator" class="tonegenerator"></div>
<p class="caption"><a href="../applets/tonegenerator.html" target="_blank">(open in new tab)</a></p>
<h4 class="question">Huh.  That's a weird sound.  OK.  So is that, like, the air moving up and down like that Example 5.1 or...</h4>
<p class="text">Not quite.  The air actually vibrates back and forth in what are called longitudinal waves.  If you look at one air molecule, it moves forwards and backwards in this pattern, and when it does, it pushes other air molecules to move the same way, thus propagating the wave.  It's not quite like that but it's close enough.  The way this actually happens is that your speaker actually receives voltage in that pattern, and when it receives voltage, its job is to move a membrane in and out according to the voltage.  It doesn't do this perfectly, absolutely not, but for most purposes it works well enough.  When the membrane moves, it pushes the air around it, which in turn pushes the next molecule and the next, etc., until it reaches your eardrums, which also move in this pattern, etc.</p>
<p class="text">Now, you should be able to hear any frequency between around 20 Hz and around 20,000 Hz.  But, you'll quickly find that not to be the case with this tone generator.  If you try a normal frequency like 440 Hz, you should be able to hear it just fine, but if you enter, say, 80 Hz, you may not.  I was actually surprised by this.  On my laptop speakers, I couldn't hear anything below about 90 Hz; even 100 Hz was hard to hear.  On my display speakers, I could hear about 85 Hz, but the volume dropped sharply and I couldn't hear anything below 80 Hz.  On my fairly nice ($40, so not <em>that</em> nice, but they're big) headphones, I could feel 40 Hz but it was at the edge of hearing.</p>
<h4 class="question">Why is that?</h4>
<p class="text">Because the speakers suck?  I'm not actually sure why you need more power and more size for lower frequencies, but you do.  That's why subwoofers exist.  I don't have a subwoofer.  The interesting thing is that you actually <em>can</em> hear notes that low on the speakers.  The piano's lowest note, for example, is A0, about 22.5 Hz.  You can probably find a YouTube video or some other recording that uses that lowest note, and you can hear it just fine.  But try it in the tone generator, and... you can't.</p>
<h4 class="question">Why?</h4>
<p class="text">Because real musical sounds aren't simple waves like the ones made by the tone generator!  We'll talk more about it later.  Much later.  Here's an example of a sawtooth wave, a sound that doesn't just look like a regular wave:</p>
<canvas id="sawtoothexample" class="keyboard" height="200" width="800"></canvas>
<p class="caption">Example 5.2</p>
<p class="text">And here's what that sounds like (watch out, it's much louder):</p>
<div id="sawtoothgenerator" class="tonegenerator"></div>
<p class="caption"><a href="../applets/sawtoothgenerator.html" target="_blank">(open in new tab)</a></p>
<p class="text">This time, you can dial the frequency down much more.  Actually, if you dial it down to even really small numbers like 0.5 Hz, you may just hear a click every two seconds (so 0.5 clicks per second), but you'll still hear it!  You can also dial the frequency <em>up</em>, far past 20,000 Hz, and you'll hear that too, but the pitch won't keep going up.  What's happening there is that there are only 44100 samples per second (so the <em>sampling rate</em> is 44100 Hz, or 44.1 kHz), so the computer simply can't make the pitches happen at all.  We'll talk more about the math later, but the point is that if you put in a frequency above 22,050 Hz (the Nyquist frequency, half of 44,100 Hz), what you're hearing is not what you want to be hearing because you're losing information between the samples.  If this doesn't make perfect sense right now, don't worry.  Hopefully, though, this helps to give you a kind of big-picture view of music theory: it goes pretty deep.</p>
<h4 class="question">Speaking of deep, you said that A0 is 22.5 Hz.  Huh?</h4>
<p class="text">So far we've talked about sound waves.  Let's move from the physical to the perceptual.</p>
<h3 class="subsection-title" id="pitch">5.1.2 Pitch</h3>
<p class="text">A sound wave (of a given shape) has two main aspects: the amplitude and the frequency.  The amplitude is how far the air vibrates.  The higher the amplitude, the louder the sound.  The frequency is how quickly the air vibrates; the higher the frequency, the higher the pitch of the sound.  Hopefully you've played around with the tone generators a bit, so this should make sense.</p>
<h4 class="question">And how do you determine, like the type of sound?  If it's an "ah" or an "ee" or a violin or a tuba or whatever?</h4>
<p class="text">Unfortunately, that's <em>really</em> complicated, and there are many aspects to this answer.  The basic answer is that it's the shape of the wave, like whether it's rounded or a sawtooth or what have you, but there's much more to it than that.  We'll never get to music theory if we stop to do this now, sadly, so we must press on.</p>
<p class="text">Here's where the math comes in: that frequency is interpreted by our brains as pitch, and when you <em>double</em> the frequency, you raise the pitch by an octave.  Oh, don't relax yet, we're not done.  The implications here are pretty deep.  The biggest thing is that what we perceive as <em>adding</em> a constant interval — like an octave — is actually a <em>multiplication</em> problem.  You add an octave to A4 and you get A5.  You multiply the frequency of A4 by 2 to get the frequency of A5.</p>
<p class="text">And the frequency of A4 is, by convention, 440 Hz.  So, A5 is double that, or 880 Hz.  A3 is half that, 220 Hz.  A2 is half <em>that</em>, so 110 Hz.  A1 is half yet again, so 55 Hz.  And A0 is half of that, which is 22.5 Hz.  Does that answer your question?</p>
<h4 class="question">Eh.  You said "about 22.5 Hz".  What you just told me is exact.  So something doesn't match.</h4>
<p class="text">That's because not everyone tunes everything the same way.  I just said that A4 is 440 Hz by convention, but some have a convention to go higher, to 441 Hz or 442 Hz or even 443 Hz, because being a bit higher gives a bit of a brighter sound.  Pitches used to be much lower in the past.  (I should mention that there are some crazy people who believe that A should be 432 Hz because of some numerological bullshit.  It's literally all bullshit.  Don't fall for it.)  Not to mention that pianos aren't always in tune, so even if you might think that an A0 <em>should</em> be 22.5 Hz, it may not be.</p>
<h4 class="question">Wait, what?  Doesn't A0 have a specific value?</h4>
<p class="text">No.  Note names are relative.  They should hopefully not vary too much so that instruments can play together, but Middle C is C4 whether it's sharp or flat, so long as it's written in the right spot on the staff.</p>
<p class="text">Anyway, going up an octave means multiplying by 2.  What about other intervals?  Well, in our 12-tone equal-tempered scale, there are 12 equal semitones.  Since going up by an interval means multiplying by some number, if a semitone involves multiplying by some number <em>s</em>, then <em>s</em><sup>12</sup> = 2, since an octave means going up by a semitone 12 times.  This means that <em>s</em> = 2<sup>1/12</sup>.</p>
<p class="text">Assuming the A440 standard (meaning that A4 is defined to be 440 Hz), we can calculate the frequency corresponding to any other pitch by multiplying or dividing by 2 and s the right number of times.  For example, to get to Bb1 we go down 3 octaves then up a semitone, so we divide by 2 three times (with the net effect that we divide by 8) and multiply by 2<sup>1/12</sup>.  We get ≈ 58.27 Hz.  For B1, we multiply this number by a further semitone, and we get ≈ 61.74 Hz.  As we can see, 60 Hz is somewhere in between.</p>
<p class="text">We can express this relationship mathematically.  We'll use C0 as our reference pitch (with a frequency of ≈ 16.35 Hz).  The number of octaves <em>O</em> that a particular frequency <em>f</em> is above C0 is therefore:</p>
<p class="equation"><em>O</em> = log<sub>2</sub>(<em>f</em>/C0) (C0 ≈ 16.35 Hz)</p>
<p class="text">We can count the number of half steps above C for a particular note, so C is 0 half steps above, C#/Db is 1, D is 2, etc.  A half step is a 1/12 of an octave, of course.  So, with <em>O</em> as defined above, floor(x) being the greatest integer less than x, and frac(x) = x – floor(x) being the fractional part of x, we can define the octave <em>o</em> and <em>pitch class</em> <em>p</em> as follows:</p>
<p class="equation"><em>o</em> = floor(<em>O</em>)<br /><em>p</em> = 12·frac(<em>O</em>)</p>
<p class="text">For frequency <em>f</em> = 440 Hz, <em>O</em> = 4.75, so <em>o</em> = 4 and <em>p</em> = 9, meaning that 440 Hz is 9 semitones above C4, or, as we already knew, A4.</p>
<p class="text">For going the other way — that is, translating a pitch to a frequency — we simply multiply our reference frequency C0 by the right number of octaves and semitones:</p>
<p class="equation"><em>f</em> = C0·2<sup><em>o</em> + <em>p</em>/12</sup></p>
<p class="text">The important mathematical insight is that pitch is the log of frequency.  As frequency goes up linearly, pitch goes up <em>much</em> more slowly.</p>
<p class="text">Let's do some demos, shall we?  Click on the color fields in the Offtonic Line Organ below to generate a (filtered) sawtooth tone at the given frequency.  Along the top of each color field, you can see the notes on the piano, with the C's pointed out.  Along the bottom, there's a hash mark every 1000 Hz.  In the top field, the <em>frequency</em> goes up uniformly as you go right (pitch is exponential); in the bottom field, the <em>pitch</em> goes up uniformly as you go right (frequency is logarithmic).  In both fields, the volume goes down if you go down.  Have fun!  Stuff is really squished in the first one, so there's an extra wide version available if you want to play with that.  Try to play some songs.</p>

<p class="text">The Offtonic Line Organ works sort of like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theremin">theremin</a>.  A theremin has two antennas, one to control pitch and the other to control volume.  As you move your hand close to the pitch antenna, the pitch changes; as you move your other hand close to the volume antenna, the volume changes.  You can get neat sci-fi effects.  Listen to <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/pamelia_kurstin_plays_the_theremin">this crazy performance in a TED talk</a> for more on this pretty incredible instrument.</p>
<p class="text">What you should notice right away is that in the upper linear organ, half of the field is taken up with a useless very high octave, a quarter with a useless still very high but not quite so high octave, an eighth with a useless very high but even less high octave, and so on, until you have barely a sliver in which to play useful notes.  Everything interesting is under 1000 Hz, apparently!  As you can see, if you go up 200 Hz from something in that sliver, you've gone up a whole lot; if you're around 10,000 Hz and you go up 200 Hz, you can barely notice a difference.  In the lower logarithmic organ, on the other hand, every octave is the same width.  Our hearing works according to the lower organ (for the most part).  We perceive an octave as a constant difference in pitch, while the octave between C0 and C1 is a <em>far, far, far</em> tinier difference in frequency than the octave between C9 and C10!</p>
<h4 class="question">This sounds much smoother than the sawtooth tone generator.  What did you do?</h4>
<p class="text">It's a secret!  Nah, it's a simple delay filter.  It would take way too long to explain, but we can at least see what the waveform might look like (acknowledging that there are a lot of tweakable factors here).  It's a bit curvier than the harsh sawtooth:</p>
<canvas id="delayedsawtoothexample" class="keyboard" height="200" width="800"></canvas>
<p class="caption">Example 5.3</p>
<p class="text">Digital audio is extremely interesting.  To me, anyway.  I'm writing this book in part because I get to play with digital audio examples and filters and Shepard tones and whatnot.  We will talk more about it when we talk more in-depth about acoustics in general, but for now, let's get back to the subject at hand.</p>
<h3 class="subsection-title" id="pitch-class">5.1.3 Pitch Class</h3>
<p class="text">A pitch class is something like C or Eb.  C can represent many different notes: Middle C (C4), the C above that (C5), the C several octaves below (C1), etc.  We call C a <em>pitch class</em>.  We use the term "pitch class" when we explicitly don't care about octaves.</p>
<h4 class="question">Why might we not care about octaves?  Why are octaves so special anyway?</h4>
<p class="text">This is a difficult question, and it's not immediately clear that octaves <em>should</em> be special.  After all, why do we perceive C4 and C5 as different instances of the same note?  Could we not just decide that the special interval is actually a perfect fifth, and C4 and G4 and D5 are all different instances of the same note?  (Yemenite Jews <a href="https://youtu.be/e-MlFf326yE?t=658">actually do that</a>.)  One plausible explanation is that the sound waves that form an octave line up really well:</p>
<canvas id="twosineexample" class="keyboard" height="200" width="800"></canvas>
<p class="caption">Example 5.4</p>
<p class="text">When you hear two notes an octave apart, then, those two notes kind of... blend into each other.  You can try that in the Offtonic Interval Organ, which plays two notes when you click on it based on horizontal and vertical position.  Get them to line up in octaves (like, for example, C3 on the horizontal axis and C4 on the vertical), and play around with it a little bit until the sound of the octave "clicks".</p>
<canvas id="intervalorgan" class="keyboard" height="800" width="800"></canvas>
<p class="caption"><a href="../applets/intervalorgan.html" target="_blank">(open in new tab)</a></p>
<h4 class="question">Holy shit!  This is really cool!</h4>
<p class="text">Eh?  Eh?  One interesting thing about this: if you go up and to the right diagonally, both notes move up together.  If you go up and to the <em>left</em> together, the two notes move in opposite directions.  When the notes move together, that's called <em>parallel motion</em> or <em>conjunct motion</em>, and when they move in opposite directions, that's called <em>contrary motion</em>.  If one note moves while the other stays the same, that's called <em>oblique motion</em>.  We'll talk much more about these soon enough, but you should be aware that contrary motion generally feels a lot more <em>satisfying</em> than parallel motion.</p>
<p class="text">The Offtonic Interval Organ above lets you play around in <em>interval space</em>.  Each point on that plane corresponds to an interval, where one note is given by the x coordinate and the other note is given by the y coordinate.  You can have three-note chord space as well, but that one's in 3D so it will be a bit difficult to build a demo, sorry!  In the other direction, we have <em>pitch space</em>, which is just one line, and your position on that line determines your pitch.  The lower half of the Offtonic Line Organ in the previous section is set in pitch space (where the x coordinate is pitch and the y coordinate is volume).</p>
<p class="text">But, if you take pitch space modulo octave equivalence, you get <em>pitch class space</em>.</p>
<h4 class="question">I'm so glad I understand abstract algebra and therefore I understood exactly what you meant by that.  But can you explain it again?  You know, for <em>other</em> people, who are not me?</h4>
<p class="text">Heh.  I told you there'd be math.</p>
<h4 class="question">You did.  But I didn't realize you meant stuff only a math major would have studied.</h4>
<p class="text">Hey, I concentrated in physics!</p>
<h4 class="question">And math.</h4>
<p class="text">...and math, yeah.  OK, fine.  But I hope other math majors out there got a nice little kick out of the algebra.  There's actually a lot more abstract algebra you can do as well as number theory, and we'll actually touch on some of it later.  But for now, here's the picture-book version of pitch space modulo octave equivalence, the Offtonic Circle Organ:</p>
<canvas id="circleorgan" class="keyboard" height="800" width="800"></canvas>
<p class="caption"><a href="../applets/circleorgan.html" target="_blank">(open in new tab)</a></p>
<h4 class="question">Heh, awesome.  Kinda funky sound.  Clicks sometimes, though.</h4>
<p class="text">You may recall Shepard tones from the previous chapter; you could play them in the Circle of Fifths keyboard.  That's what this is, except it's continuous, and also, you can vary the octave.  I thought it would be cool.  The point of the Shepard tones is that the pitch rises as you go around the circle, but when you wind up back around, you're actually at the same pitch where you started, so it really does make different octaves the same.  There is some clicking, true.  Sorry about that.  Clicks usually happen whenever something in the sound wave changes too quickly, which will happen if you move your mouse really fast from one side to the other.  The more problematic clicking is when you cross over the C line, because that's kind of a seam in the Shepard tones.  Gotta be one somewhere.  I tried to smooth that seam out, but unfortunately it's not perfect.  Still cool, though!</p>
<p class="text">Let's talk about what this pitch class space actually means.  If you go up the page a bit, to the second half of the Line Organ, you'll experience pitch space.  The pitch goes up as you go from left to right.  You start at some low octave (infinitely low, technically, but there's only so much space) and, as you move right, you get to higher and higher octaves (infinitely high, also).  Since human hearing (and audio production) has limits, there's no point in going too low or too high in one of these demos, but pitch space is essentially a line.  If we mark that line at every octave, we can consider just one octave interval of that line, cut it off from the rest of the line, and glue the ends together.  Now we have a pitch class <em>circle</em>, like the Circle Organ you just experienced.  If you go around, you'll wind up back where you started.</p>
<p class="text">Mathematically, the pitch space is a line that spans infinitely many octaves, and doing this modulo operation with the space of octaves gives you pitch class space, which is a circle that spans one octave.</p>
<p class="text">We can use numbers, too!  Let's consider the interval with our reference pitch C0.  To get to C0 from C0, you multiply by 1, obviously.  To get to the next octave, you multiply by 2, so let's say that C0 is 1 and C1 is 2.  Then C2 is 4, C3 is 8, C4 is 16, and so on.  Remember, you multiply by 2 to go up an octave, so the octaves of C0 are simply the powers of 2.  For <em>any</em> note, you can multiply or divide by 2 until you get to a number that's between 1 and 2 (including 1, not including 2).  So, for example, the note 5 (with frequency 5·C0) is the same pitch class as 5/2, which is the same pitch class as 5/4 = 1.25.  In other words, if two notes are related by multiply or dividing by powers of 2, those two notes are the <em>same note</em> but in different octaves.  This is going to be very important to understand when we start talking about frequency ratios of intervals.</p>
<p class="text">If you're a math major, you can think of pitch space as the multiplicative group <em><strong>R</strong></em><sup>*</sup><sub>&gt;0</sub> of the positive reals, and octave space is the multiplicative group generated by {2}.  Pitch class space is therefore <em><strong>R</strong></em><sup>*</sup><sub>&gt;0</sub>/{2}<sup>*</sup>.  If you aren't a math major, you can totally ignore what I just said.</p>
<h4 class="question">OK.  I'm going to do that.  By the way, what is up with the colors?</h4>
<p class="text">I wanted a way to represent pitch and pitch class intuitively, so I came up with this idea: put the pitch classes around the color wheel, and make pitch be the lightness in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV">HSL</a> setup.  So C is red, C# is orange, D is yellow, etc., and lower octaves get dark while higher octaves get light.  I originally set this up with 11 octaves, from C0 to C11 since there's more human hearing above C10 (but not above C11), but that upper octave is just not practical much of the time.  You can see these colors in the Line Organ, where I decided to use the vertical axis for volume, represented by a gray gradient.  In the Circle Organ, I just made a color wheel, with the octave being not the octave of the pitch but the center of the Shepard tone envelope (don't worry if this makes no sense).  In the Interval Organ (the plaid-looking one), I just combined the colors of two line organs in perpendicular directions.</p>
<p class="text">I'm using these colors consistently.  Even in the Offtonic Keyboard and in the Circle of Fifths Keyboard, the keys light up in these colors.  I think it helps add a consistency of design to the applets in this book.  Compositionally, consistency of design is important; if you're writing a piece of music, you'll generally want all of it to feel like it belongs to the same piece of music.  In the melodic analyses we did in the last chapter, I pointed this out to you, especially in the rhythms, which are a prominent component of this sort of unity.  Throughout the book there are other design elements with consistency, especially in the color palettes: the colors of links, the colors of graphics, the fonts in the applets, etc.  When you listen to a piece of music, look for things like that wherever you can.  Repetition is how you win the heart of your listeners.</p>
<h3 class="subsection-title" id="measuring-small-intervals">5.1.4 Measuring Small Intervals</h3>
<p class="text">One more thing we need to discuss, number-wise: small intervals.  This is really simple.  You know how there are 12 semitones in an octave?  We further divide those semitones into 100 <em>cents</em> each, so there are... 1200 cents in an octave.  An interval of a major third, for example, is 400 cents.  Perfect fifth, 700 cents.  Minor ninth, 1300 cents.  This lets us talk about small differences in pitch.  For example, if you're just a tiny bit sharp, you might be playing/singing a perfect fourth of 505 cents instead of 500 cents.  A good tuner will tell you this.  If you're a little flat, you could be at 490 cents instead of 500 cents.</p>
<p class="text">We also use cents to talk about precise interval sizes.  For example, an interval of 5/4 is ≈ 386.31 cents.  This is considerably flatter (around 14 cents) than the equal-tempered major third of 400 cents, but... it sounds <em>better</em>!  For some definitions of "better", anyway.  We'll talk more about this, and hear examples, soon.</p>
<h4 class="question">Equal-tempered?  What does that mean?  And what's an interval of 5/4?</h4>
<p class="text">We're not going to talk too much about temperaments in particular right now, but "12-tone equal-temperament" means (roughly) that the octave is divided into 12 equal semitones.</p>
<h4 class="question">Isn't that obvious?  Of course the octave is 12 equal semitones, right?</h4>
<p class="text">Well...  No, not historically.  Equal temperament is only about 200 years old.  Before this they were using other temperaments where the semitones weren't all the same size, which meant that different keys actually had different sounds!  An interval might be perfectly in tune in one key but very out of tune in another.  I mentioned the 5/4 interval of around 386 cents, right?  People liked that sound a lot, so they tried to play their major thirds with that interval size, but the math doesn't work out, so some major thirds have to be of a different (and far worse-sounding) size.</p>
<h4 class="question">Why doesn't the math work out?</h4>
<p class="text">When we talk about "an interval of 5/4", what we mean is that the frequency of note 2 is 5/4 (1.25) times that of note 1.  Recall that multiplying a frequency by a constant number always raises the pitch by the same interval.  We've talked a lot about multiplying the pitch by 2 and going up by an octave, right?  Here, we're talking about multiplying by 5/4, which takes the pitch up by about 14 cents less than a major third.  Now, if you go up a major third from C in equal temperament, you get to E.  Another major third, G#/Ab.  Another major third, back to C, an octave higher.  The major third in equal temperament is 4 semitones, so you multiply by 2<sup>4/12</sup> each time, and if you do this three times, you get 2<sup>4/12</sup>·2<sup>4/12</sup>·2<sup>4/12</sup> = 2, an octave.  Let's try this with 5/4: (5/4)·(5/4)·(5/4) = 125/64 ≠ 2.  We're about 41 cents short!  So if the C-E major third is 5/4 and the E-G# major third is 5/4, the G#-C diminished fourth <em>can't</em> also be 5/4.  It has to be 32/25 in order to keep the octave at 2 (5/4·5/4·32/25 = 2), which is about 427 cents — it's <em>really</em> sharp and it sounds horrendously ugly!  These "bad" intervals left over from "good" intervals are historically known as <em>wolf intervals</em>.  With equal temperament, we've found a way to make <em>every</em> interval a little out of tune (except the octave), so nothing is perfectly nice like the 5/4 third, but also nothing is abominable like the 32/25 wolf third.</p>

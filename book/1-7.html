			<h2 class="section-title" id="summary">1.7 Summary</h2>
			<h4 class="question">Yes!  Now, what should I know in this chapter?</h4>
			<p class="text">Ah, yes.  You should be able to identify any note on the keyboard, especially Middle C.  You should be able to identify any note in treble or bass clef, and you should be able to count any rhythm in 4/4 (or similar time signatures, like 3/4, 2/4, 5/4, etc.), with a metronome, even if the rhythm has dots or ties.  You should be able to sing any reasonably easy bit of sheet music.</p>
			<h4 class="question">Isn't that kind of a lot?</h4>
			<p class="text">It is.  I'm kind of hoping that it's not <em>all</em> new to you.  If it's really a lot, just work hard.</p>
			<h4 class="question">Easy for <em>you</em> to say!</h4>
			<p class="text">Hehe.  Yep!</p>
			<p class="text">Anyway, in the next chapters we'll be looking at music notation in more depth before we move on to music theory proper.  So far, this is just the basics of reading music that we're talking about.  You're probably here for scales and chords, aren't you?  The problem is that without this fundamental stuff, it's all going to go over your head.  Here's where we build the base of your knowledge!  See you in the next chapter.</p>

<h4 class="question">So you'll finally tell me how to compose?</h4>
<p class="text">No.</p>
<h4 class="question">...Wait, what?</h4>
<p class="text">Composition is a <em>creative</em> endeavor.  I can tell you some of the things I do, but in the end — actually, in the beginning — you have to come up with your own ideas.</p>

<? createTableOfContents($label) ?>

<h3 class="subsection-title" id="pre-composition">8.3.1 Pre-Composition</h3>

<p class="text">There is no set order to composition.  Some people write chords first, then melody; others write melody first, then chords.  Many people think both of these things are stupid because they're improvising on drums; there are no melodies or chords.  So to even ask the melody/chords question, we had to make quite a few assumptions about the music.  Let's therefore take a step back.</p>
<p class="text">For a successful <em>planned</em> composition (that is, not improvisation), it's important to prepare.  You don't have to know everything about your yet-unwritten before you start, but the more you know, the better.  This phase is known as <em>pre-composition</em>.  During pre-composition, you nail down the product type, the medium, the genre, that sort of thing.  You could always write a little bit and <em>then</em> make more decisions.</p>
<h4 class="question">So what do I actually do?</h4>
<p class="text">Plan your work!  Figure out what the big moments are going to be and when they'll happen.  Figure out the form, the tempo, the key, all those things.</p>
<h4 class="question">But what if I don't know what I'm going to write?</h4>
<p class="text">Ah.  Yes.  Composition is a creative endeavor, as I've said a few times already.  This means that you actually need ideas.  When you decide to write a piece of music, you should <em>already</em> know what you're going to write; pre-composition is the planning that you need to do with that material.  How do you know what you're going to write?  Well, see, if you <em>don't</em> know, don't start a composition!  But to get that initial idea, you need <em>inspiration</em>, and there are a few possible ways to try to force some inspiration, but it's not reliable.  It helps, if you want to compose, to constantly be in the mindset of "how can I use this in a composition" whenever you hear... anything.  Some of those ideas you might want to flesh out a bit more, possibly just in your mind, while others, not so much.</p>
<p class="text">A great method that I've used on occasion is what I have just decided to call the shitwall method.</p>
<h4 class="question">Nice name.</h4>
<p class="text">Thanks.  The shitwall method is when you throw shit at the wall until it sticks.  Find yourself a musical instrument of some sort — keyboard, voice, guitar, whatever you're comfortable with — and just <em>play</em> for a while.  Improvise whatever you want.  Maybe even stop looking at the keyboard while you do it (if you're playing a keyboard) and let yourself make "mistakes".  The less control you have, the better; you can focus more on listening and imagining than coming up with what to play next.  Let your fingers (or whatever) do their own thing and meanwhile just listen.  Maybe you'll hit on something you think you can expand out to become a full piece of music.  If you do this when you're out, you may want to have a voice recorder app on your phone to make a note to yourself if you sing something you like.</p>
<p class="text">You can also start with some non-musical idea and try to make some music out of it.  Maybe there's a particular mood you want to create, or you want to write a piece of music about something or that evokes something.  So you set about creating a texture, figuring out what sound you're going for, etc., before coming up with the melody and the chords (or whatever).  I'm not David Wise and I have no way of actually knowing what he was thinking when he wrote the jungle theme for Donkey Kong Country, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvtgI9jUd3w">DK Island Swing</a>, but I can bet you that he started with the idea of writing a jungle theme and took it from there.  "What ho," he may have said, "I wish to write a jungle theme.  How shall I begin?  What tone colours shall I use?"  David Wise is British, so he spells "colors" with a U in his thoughts.  "Ah, brilliant!  I shall start off with jungle drums and jungle noises!  Anon!  Ah, but marry, what rhythms shall I use?"  David Wise is the modern Shakespeare of videogame music.  "I shall tap my hands on a table at random and think of green jungles and overgrown monkeys until it sounds good!"  And thus was born DK Island Swing.  From then on he started adding more and more instruments, including finally a bass, and once that bass was there, he just extrapolated, and eventually he got tired of it, made a new section, added a saxophone doing some jazzy melody off of the minor pentatonic scale because the bass part ended up in minor, and that melody, which doesn't start until over a minute into the track, became the beloved Donkey Kong Country theme we all know and love, reused in the rest of the series because they couldn't leave it out.</p>
<h4 class="question">I don't know it.</h4>
<p class="text">You d...  How c...  I will resist the urge to kill you.  I <em>will</em> resist it!  ...OK, I've resisted it.  You're safe.  <em>For now</em>.</p>
<h4 class="question">Dude.</h4>
<p class="text">Anyway, I have no idea if this is what he actually did or not, but it's what I would have done.  But I'm not responsible for the beloved music of one of the best-known videogame franchises, so you should take my opinion with a grain of bananas here.</p>
<h4 class="question">What about Donkey Kong Country 3?</h4>
<p class="text">What about it?</p>
<h4 class="question">And what about Eveline (Fischer) Novakovic and Robin Beanland?</h4>
<p class="text">I don't see how they're relevant?  I'm going to say it; Donkey Kong Country 3 is not my favorite game, nor does it feature my favorite music.  Neither iteration, really.  See, what happened was that Rare was extremely successful with Donkey Kong Country, in large part because of Wise's music (and Fischer's; Beanland just did one track that never played for more than a few seconds during the game anyway) and the atmospheric feelings it helped create, along with a bunch of other innovations and generally great platforming.  So they made a sequel, Donkey Kong Country 2, which was <em>also</em> wildly successful, this time featuring Wise alone as composer.  Donkey Kong Country 2's soundtrack is much less atmospheric and more melodic, with fairly tight thematic unity throughout; the settings were also less grandiose and less generic, but the gameplay totally made up for it.  Really solid game with solid music; I recommend you give it a listen.  Both these games came out for the SNES in the mid-90's, but then Nintendo released its next console, the N64.  How was Rare going to cash in on the DKC craze?  The answer was obvious: have its B team put out a rushed and lackluster Donkey Kong Country 3 for the obsolete SNES, with awful cartoonish enemy sprites, that idiotic elephant, and 100% gimmicky levels.  And Eveline Fischer's music was just... not that great.  No offense to her.  It was just kind of generic, as opposed to Wise's melodic and thematic DKC2 score.  There are some great tracks in there, like the underwater theme.  I recommend giving that soundtrack a listen too.  Eventually, Nintendo and Rare decided to re-release the Donkey Kong Country trilogy on the Game Boy Advance, and they had David Wise recompose the entire DKC3 soundtrack because the atmospheric effects of Novakovic's (by then she'd gotten married already) soundtrack didn't translate to the crappy speakers on the GBA.  Except that he wasn't given much time to do it, so it's not necessarily the world's greatest masterpiece.  You should listen to both.  Actually, you should play DKC1 and DKC2 and then play both versions of DKC3 (the GBA version has some pretty neat added levels that are less gimmicky than the original ones).  Except you probably shouldn't play DKC3 at all, because it kind of sucks.</p>
<p class="text">Sorry, what were we talking about again?</p>
<h4 class="question">COMPOSITION, YOU IDIOT.</h4>
<p class="text">Hey, you did ask.</p>
<h4 class="question">Yeah, but you didn't have to <em>answer</em>!</h4>
<p class="text">I suppose.  But there's at least something relevant hidden in that story.  David Wise had to do a rush job for the DKC3 GBA soundtrack.  Why is that bad?  Because it takes time to do pre-composition.  When I want to write a piece of music, I usually spend <em>weeks</em> thinking about it before I write anything.  This is the time it takes to go from the idea of the piece to the point when I can start making it real.  That's not true every time — I've definitely written music on short notice that I'm really proud of.  But I usually spend quite a while <em>audiating</em> — hearing the music in my head — and coming up with ideas.  For example, the last several years, most of my writing has actually been a cappella arrangements of Jewish songs for my group.  Before I write an arrangement, I spend usually weeks thinking about what I want to make happen in each section, musically.  Some songs can be harmonized in different ways, so I'll actually plan out ahead of time what chords I'll use where.  One of my arrangements is trilingual, so before I started, I mapped out which verses will be in which language, and I even worked in some rhymes across languages.  Starts with Portuguese singing "É uma cobra, é um pau" and English singing "It's a snake, it's a stick" at the same time, then English "it is John," Portuguese "é José," Hebrew "im nichyeh lo namut, lo namut ki nichyeh".  I rhymed Portuguese "José" with Hebrew "nichyeh" and used all three languages at the same time.  I'm very proud of that one.</p>
<h4 class="question">I think I recognize that song.  Águas de Março?</h4>
<p class="text">Yep!  Portuguese and English lyrics were both written by Tom Jobim, and there's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FROTESdrwZE">Hebrew version</a> as well.  There's a tradition of doing it bilingual, so I figured why not make it trilingual?  I almost added French too, but then it would have been too much.  In the weeks in which I spent thinking about how I was going to write this song, I ran through the language possibilities and did my research.  I looked into the chords (different versions have different chords), the rhythms, etc.  The arrangement I ended up with is pretty simple and fairly true to the recording with Tom Jobim and Elis Regina you've seen already.  The real preparation went into the format of the piece, the languages, etc.  In some of my other pieces, I was more imaginative with my arranging instead of staying close to some existing recording, and in those cases the pre-composition consisted of identifying which verses would get paired with which settings.  In one such piece, I decided that I wanted the third line, which mentioned stationing guards, to sound martial, and by playing around with the song on the piano, I came up with a nice chromatic countermelody for the second and fourth lines.  All four lines end with "&lt;<em>something</em>&gt; day and &lt;<em>something</em>&gt; night" (in Hebrew) and that's a little hypnotic, so I decided that there would be a fairly constant repetition of that phrase, staggered between two parts, underneath the melody.  In Hebrew, the first line is "Karev yom, karev yom asher hu lo yom v'lo laylah," so two parts would just constantly repeat "yom v'lo laylah" in octaves, except that one part would be two beats off from the other, making a really cool effect.  I wish I had a recording I could share.  But the point is that I had this <em>before</em> I actually started writing!  From playing around on the piano, I had a key — C# minor, because... I liked it in C# minor — and a countermelody, and a plan for which sections would have what (not for the whole piece, just enough to get started).</p>
<p class="text">I'm calling it pre-composition, but pre-composition doesn't stop when you start writing the piece.  Unless you were able to write the entire piece in one sitting, the time you <em>don't</em> spend writing should be spent dreaming and imagining about what comes next.  You don't have to get <em>all</em> the details before you start; you just need to get enough details that your writing becomes automatic.  There is a class of problems to solve when you're actually writing music, namely how to make the music sound like what you want it to sound like.  We'll spend a while talking about that in the coming chapters.  Pre-composition is when you decide what you want it to sound like in the first place.</p>
<p class="text">At this point, it's incredibly useful to have a solid knowledge of theory and a wide repertoire, and I'll tell you why: the more you know and have internalized, the more the music will write itself.  You start thinking of some musical idea, and you let that song keep playing in your head.  Well, it's only going to do what you can imagine.  You can try things you might not normally do and compose... mechanically, but usually that results in your music sounding kind of disjointed.  I've done that when I've experimented with new concepts.  On the other hand, if you're familiar with, say, chromatic mediants, you may decide that your music can proceed in that direction, and you might not even realize that you did that!</p>
<h4 class="question">What are chromatic mediants?  Also, can I still use them if I don't know what they are?</h4>
<p class="text">I'll answer your second question first: YEP.  I knew what chromatic mediants sounded like <em>way</em> before I knew the theory concept.  They're actually pretty common.  We'll talk about them later in more depth, but the basic gist of it is that a chord can go to a chord a third away (major or minor) with fewer than two common tones, and that relationship is called a <em>chromatic mediant</em> relationship.  For example, C major and E major are chromatic mediants, while C major and E minor, with two common tones, are diatonic mediants.  From C major, E minor and A minor have two common tones, E major, Eb major, A major, and Ab major have one, and Eb minor and Ab minor have none.  From C minor, Eb major and Ab major have two, Eb minor, E minor, Ab minor, and A minor have one, and E major and A major have none.  Generally when we work with chromatic mediants we leverage that common tone, so the relationships with no common tone are less used.  An example here would be a C major chord with an E in the melody that goes to an A major chord with the E still in the melody.  The common tone, the E, anchors the progression and makes the two chords sound connected.  The thing is, you may have never heard of this idea of chromatic mediants, but you've probably heard music that uses it (it's very common), so you may think of using this technique in your music without having a name for it.  We'll discuss it more later, of course.</p>
<p class="text">It could be incredibly useful during pre-composition to actually make a rough sketch of the music, with at least some of the major ideas.  I like to do this on paper — you know, wood pulp processed into thin sheets?  You can just print off music manuscript paper; I'm not even going to bother linking it because it's so easily available online.  If you don't want to do that, you could take notebook paper, with lines, and draw smaller lines between the lines already there to create staves.  It's a bit messy, but who cares?  You should be able to do this <em>away</em> from any musical instrument or playback.  WHy?  Because you should be able to hear the music you're writing yourself.  And if you write something that doesn't sound very good... well, that's OK, because it's not your final draft.  This is useful <em>even if your product isn't sheet music</em>, because the point is to get your thoughts out so that you can work on them more deeply.  You can write a kind of reduced score, even if it's just for a few sections.  Some of my pieces began this way.  Of course, if I ever end up composing something while walking or whatever, it's important to write it down immediately before I forget, right?  I wrote a niggun once while walking to work and luckily I found a notebook that I could turn into makeshift manuscript paper to write it down.  When inspiration strikes, you gotta be ready!</p>
<p class="text">So OK, you've come up with some ideas.  What do you do next?</p>

<h3 class="subsection-title" id="development">8.3.2 Development</h3>

<p class="text">You start writing, of course!  Or typing, or recording, or whatever it is you make.  Of course.  And pretty soon you run into the obvious problem: you <em>kinda</em> thought this through, but you didn't <em>really</em> think it through.  Whoops!  So now you're stuck.  How do you proceed?</p>
<h4 class="question">Development!</h4>
<p class="text">Yes!  How did you know?</p>
<h4 class="question">Um, general knowledge?  Also, it's the title of this subsection.</h4>
<p class="text">...Fine.  So what is development?</p>
<h4 class="question">It's... uh... well, you know, you're much better at explaining it than I am; why don't you give it a shot?</h4>
<p class="text">Riiiight.  Development is actually fairly difficult to describe and to do well.  The basic gist is that you take some aspect of the music and you just rework it and rework it into music that's different but still sounds related.  We usually think of development in the context of classical music, which is often more free-form than pop music, but here's an example we've already seen from Linkin Park's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVTXPUF4Oz4">In The End</a>:</p>
<? createExample('In The End', true); ?>
<p class="text">Back in <? sectionLinkShort('pop chords 9'); ?> we analyzed the melody and we saw how repetitive it is.  But it's not <em>that</em> repetitive, because the harmony changes, the rhythm changes, etc. — in other words, the melody develops.  So look at the motifs.  Measure 1, we have Db Db Eb F, and in the next measure we have F F Db Db, which is almost the first motif inverted.  Measure 3, we have the first one again, but with a faster rhythm; measure 4 is different.  Measures 5, 6, and 7 are just like 1, 2, and 3, and then 8 and 9 are a variation on 4 and the beginning of 5.  The words at measure 1 are "I try so <em>hard</em>".  What does this all mean?  I don't know what the Linkin Park guys were thinking when they wrote this, but there aren't a lot of different ideas here.  There's this one melodic idea at measure 1 that gets inverted at measure 2 and repeated at 3, and the whole thing happens again in 5, 6, and 7, with a different thing only happening at 4 and 8 (and 9, the continuation of 8).  This economy of ideas means that there's <em>unity</em> in the composition.  The music sounds like itself, not like many different pieces next to each other (not that there's anything wrong with that).  Meanwhile, the chords repeat too!  In the end, you can take a few tiny ideas and repeat them and iterate on them until they become an entire piece.</p>
<p class="text">The amount of development you actually need to do varies wildly depending on genre.  Some classical genres use a form called <em>sonata form</em>, which is a structured way to approach the kind of free-form composition common in classical music.  The music begins with an <em>exposition</em>, which plays the themes, continues with a <em>development</em>, which iterates on the themes, and finishes with a <em>recapitulation</em>, which is basically the exposition again but with a twist.  There's plenty of variation possible in this structure, like an intro, a coda, you name it, but that's the basic skeleton of sonata form.  However, even the exposition is full of development.  I've talked about Pete Schickele's announcing of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0vHpeUO5mw">Beethoven's Symphony Nº5, Movement I</a>, and that goes in detail into the different parts of sonata form, but we can see a whole lot of development <em>right at the start</em>!  Look at the <a href="http://ks.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/0/0c/IMSLP52624-PMLP01586-Beethoven_Werke_Breitkopf_Serie_1_No_5_Op_67.pdf">first page of this score on IMSLP</a>.  Violins start off with G G G Eb, a four-note motif.  Beethoven was probably thinking, hm, that sounds cool; what should I do next?  Oh, ha, let's just play it again but lower!  Third bar, violins have F F F D.  It's the same thing, almost.  Well, <em>now</em> Beethoven is out of ideas!  So he just repeats it, more softly, and staggers entrances.  Second violins have G G G Eb; violas continue with Ab Ab Ab G; first violins answer with Eb Eb Eb C.  Same thing happens again but on a different chord, and the chord builds all the way to the second page with the full orchestra, including the timpani (notice, at the fermata, how the first violins hold the high G when everyone else rests).  All of the music so far, and also for several bars following, is based on this single four-note idea that just gets repeated and reworked, over and over, quickly and slowly, at different pitch levels, with different backgrounds and harmonies, to essentially fill page space.  It's not until the first violins have Eb G C C C in page 4, second system, 7th measure of the system, where an actual new idea comes in, and you can see how it's still built off of the same motif even so.  All of the accompaniment is still the same four-note motif.  By the end of that system, the theme has been collapsed down in the first violins, but it's still recognizable and it's all part of the same theme.  Finally, in the second system of page 5, the horns have a thing based on the motif, to which the first violins respond with something that's <em>actually</em> different.  Inside all of this, you can see Beethoven's genius lack of imagination.  This particular movement of this particular symphony is <em>the</em> most famous work in the classical canon <em>because</em> Beethoven couldn't come up with a second theme for all that time.  And oh, the development section doesn't even start until page 8!</p>
<p class="text">Everything we've seen so far in the first half of the exposition is development, but it's <em>motivic</em> development.  The four-note motif gets repeated and twisted and beat to death and to life again in new and interesting ways.  The development section is more about <em>thematic</em> development.</p>
<h4 class="question">What's the difference?</h4>
<p class="text">Mostly, there isn't one, but you can think of it as the kind of chunk that gets iterated upon.  The development section is kind of a remix of the entire first theme (the horns in page 5 announce the second theme, so the first theme is everything before that), so rather than taking a four-note motif and shoving it through a blender, it takes the melodies and harmonies and instrumentations and textures from before and blends <em>those</em>.  Really, though, both kinds of development are happening.</p>
<p class="text">The point of development is this economy of ideas.  In addition to making the work unified, as we talked about in the previous section, coming up with new ideas is <em>hard</em>.  So when you do come up with one, you can use development to bleed that stone as far as it goes.  Take a motif and transpose it, change the intervals, turn it upside down, make it slower or faster, have different voices use it at different times or the same time, build a melody out of it, build harmonies out of it, etc.  Use it as a basis for new ideas, too.  If you come up with some sort of line in counterpoint to your idea, you can always decide to make that secondary line a primary one instead, and hey, you have a new idea!</p>
<p class="text">Thematic/motivic development is another occasion when knowing the conventions of your genre can be helpful, because some repetition can be good and some can be bad.  For example, if you're writing pop music and you come up with only four chords, hey, that's, like, half of a song (the other half is some cheesy lyrics about love or whatever)!  If you're writing a symphony, on the other hand, development is when you can decide to change your instrumentation or randomly insert a <em>fugato</em> section — that's when there's basically a fugue.  Mozart and Beethoven both liked to do that to spice things up.  I personally like adding wacky harmonies and dissonant canons.  When in doubt, just repeat something you've already done.  That's not the lazy way out; that's the way to make sure your listeners actually learn and follow the music!</p>

<h3 class="subsection-title" id="finishing">8.3.3 Finishing a Piece</h3>

<p class="text">You've come up with ideas and developed them.  But at some point (presumably) you have to stop composing the piece in order to release it somehow, whether as a score or as a recording or as a performance or what have you.  When is it... done?</p>
<p class="text">For pop music, it's usually a pretty obvious answer: you have verse 1, chorus, verse 2, chorus, bridge, chorus, song ends.  Or something like that, right, there's variation.  The same goes for other genres with generally clear forms; a march goes intro, first strain, first strain, second strain, second strain, trio, break strain, trio, break strain, trio, song ends.  Again, you can have variation, but when you decide on the form during pre-composition, all you have to do during actual composition is add content to the frame you've already built.  But for music that's more free-form, including a lot of classical music, a lot of pop music, and many other genres, it's harder to tell.</p>
<p class="text">Knowing your genre is helpful here, because different genres have different ending conventions.  Pop music, for example, may just repeat the chorus forever and fade out, like Weird Al's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqDBB0no6dQ">Pancreas</a>, or it may just end on a simple stinger chord like his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzo6NJBKco">Hardware Store</a>, or it may have a long drawn-out ending that goes all out like his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE37e1eK2mY">Albuquerque</a>.  Fade-outs are only actually possible in recordings, which should be obvious but it's worth mentioning.  But it sure as hell didn't stop Mahler from trying in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHXJw9avAn0">Symphony No. 9</a>.  In jazz, there's another convention that often gets used: a really dissonant final chord, often more dissonant than the rest of the harmony in the piece.  Duke Ellington does it in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkLBSLxo5LE">this recording of Juan Tizol's Caravan</a>, and in classical-land, Vincent Persichetti does it in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjocQ4SQuVQ">Symphony No. 6</a>.  Other great ways to go out are a <em>shout chorus</em>, a kind of triumphant return of the chorus with the full ensemble playing/singing loudly, full instrumentation, etc.  In jazz, that comes after a lot of improvisation and solos; Glenn Miller's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CI-0E_jses">In The Mood</a> ends like that.  The same applies in pop music, where the last chorus of Bon Jovi's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDK9QqIzhwk">Livin' On A Prayer</a> is louder and higher (but then it fades out, so it's a combination of effects).  This chorus is an example of another ending effect in pop music, which is to play the shout chorus in a higher key.  Here, the key goes up a minor third, which is fairly common.  Boaz Mauda's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adgvz48xQZQ">Masa Chayai</a> does the same thing.  19th century Italian operatic overtures take a different route; they instead have an extended coda where you know it's about to end for a long time before it actually ends.  Rossini does this in the overture to <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6APyu868o">Italian in Algiers</a>, with a coda lasting almost a whole minute.  This is actually clever, because the end of the overture is when the audience is supposed to sit down and shut up, so the extended ending is like flashing the house lights to tell people to be quiet.  But it's not just overtures to 19th century Italian operas that do this; the extended ending in barbershop music is called a <em>tag</em>, and the Vocal Spectrum rendition of Alan Menken's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNmW4t22v0s">Go the Distance</a> (from Disney's Hercules) has a long tag (starts at about 3:09 when the lead hits that really long Ab and never breathes again for almost 30 seconds).  Feature of the genre!</p>
<h4 class="question">So which one should I use?</h4>
<p class="text">Well, that depends, doesn't it?  Audience expectations are part of it.  If you're writing a more serious piece, maybe a shout chorus is not how you want to go out, right?  Most importantly, the ending leaves a taste in the listener's mouth.</p>
<h4 class="question">A sound in the listener's ear, you mean?  You got your senses switched.</h4>
<p class="text">It's a fucking metaphor!  Also, I have some synæsthesia, but <em>that's not the point</em>!  How the piece ends is how the audience will feel at the end, how the piece will be remembered, etc.  You may want to wrap the music up nicely.  Queen does this in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ9rUzIMcZQ">Bohemian Rhapsody</a>, which is a <em>rhapsody</em> — it consists of several sections with different melodies — where the different sections feel quite different from each other.  The last section is more of a downer than an upper, but it hearkens back to the feel at the beginning of the song, being a callback of sorts.  On the other hand, the overture to Italian in Algiers above ends with a long, breathless coda to get people ready and excited for an entire opera still to come.  Songs with fade-outs often want the listener to keep jamming to the chorus, since the song feels permanently unresolved.  A big, loud ending serves to end on an excited note; a soft ending may leave the listener thinking.  Vocal Spectrum's tag in Go the Distance is more of a show-off bit, because you can't listen to that and <em>not</em> express amazement that they can even do it.</p>
<p class="text">You generally want the ending to be in proportion to the song as a whole, because otherwise it just <em>feels</em> unbalanced.  A quick ending to a long piece generates an underwhelming "is that all?" feeling, while a long ending to a short piece feels kind of pointless.</p>
<h4 class="question">So if an 8-minute piece ought to have a 30-second ending, a 4-hour show should have a 15-minute ending, right?</h4>
<p class="text">OK, so "in proportion" may not be the best way to put it.  The point is that one needs to use taste.  That said, a 15-minute ending is not out of the question.  If you have a 4-hour show, you probably have a lot of plot that needs to wrap up in musical finales!  If you imagine a narrative shape in general, with rising action, a climax, a denouement, etc., a piece of music could have a similar shape, except that music doesn't have to obey the rigors of storytelling.  The piece can end in the climax rather than the denouement; there can of course be many climaxes; etc.  But the narrative model is not a bad one.</p>
<p class="text">You also usually want the ending to be <em>familiar</em>.  What do I mean?  Well, when you've been listening to a piece of music, you've been getting acquainted with it, learning it.  By calling back to earlier elements, you end on something that the listener already understands.  The second movement of Holst's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLbP6qpI1YI">First Suite in Eb</a>, for example, has a fairly long ending section that's just a combination of all of the themes from earlier in the movement at the same time, reordered and developed.  When the ending starts, you know that it's the ending because you're hearing the themes in this new context.  In a way, a familiar ending to a piece of music is analogous to the ending of a story.  A good story ending wraps up existing plot threads in a satisfying way, possibly even involving some transformed element from the very beginning to bring things full circle, as it were.  It would be a bit silly if Moby-Dick somehow ended with Captain Kirk and the Starship Enterprise, having traveled back in time, photon torpedoing the shit out of the Pequod in order to save the whales, because such a plot would be <em>highly</em> uncharacteristic for the Enterprise and its crew (and also it would thematically undermine the irony of the whiteness of the whale and break the societal allegory it represents).  That said, it would probably make Moby-Dick somewhat more readable.</p>
<h4 class="question">Have you seen Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, by any chance?</h4>
<p class="text">Huh?  I don't know.  I fail to see how that's relevant.</p>
<p class="text">Point is, the ending really ought to be a continuation of the development, but endings have their own tropes and their own typical ways of progressing.  The more everything is motivically and thematically related within the piece, the more satisfying the ending.  On the other hand, the more motivically and thematically related the ending, the more obvious it is, and if you listen to the endings of different pieces, you'll quickly realize that you don't <em>want</em> that full wrap-up every time.  For some songs, a fade-out — not a real ending, since the song doesn't actually <em>end</em>, you just stop listening to it — is perfect.  For others, a simple dissonant chord will suffice.  Sometimes, it should end with a soft solo rather than a bombastic tutti.  Sometimes it should speed up; sometimes it should slow down.  What you do with your ending depends on what effect you want it to have.  There's no prescription for a good ending; you have to pick what's appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="question">I've composed a piece.  Now what?</h4>
<p class="text">...I personally can't really answer that.  When the product is sheet music, you probably want to have it published or performed; when it's a recording, you probably want to mix it, master it, release it to the world, etc.  If your piece is based on someone else's music, you probably need to look into licensing, which will vary depending on your jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="text">Do make sure that you've properly looked over your music, though.  Typos happen.  You may end up with a wrong note that you didn't notice at first, or incorrect lyrics, bad articulations, etc.  There could be some formatting thing you messed up, or an enharmonic equivalent you didn't mean (an A# when you wanted a Bb, for example).  You may even have written something unplayable by accident.  I hope all this sounds obvious, but I've definitely finished music that turned out to have typos.  That kind of thing is really annoying, so avoid it!</p>
<p class="text">Another important part of the checklist is proper formatting.  In a performance it doesn't matter; in a recording, you should probably export an MP3 or whatever format you want (MP3 is popular but it's <em>not</em> lossless; you do lose some quality when you export an MP3 that you don't in, say, a WAV).  For sheet music, though, proper formatting means a whole lot of things.  You need to make sure that the score is legible, and if you wrote using a C score — a score in which all instruments are at concert pitch — you probably want to make it into a transposing score.  There shouldn't be score elements on top of each other.  If you're making piano music or vocal music, the score is fine as the end product, but for more complicated music you'll want to make parts for each instrument as well as a score.  Those parts need to look neat, and they should have page turns where it's least inconvenient.  Good notation programs will try to pick a spot for the page turn automatically that is near rests, but you should go through the parts yourself and make sure that the page turns happen appropriately (if it's even possible).  The parts should, of course, be transposed to the instrument's key if the instrument is transposing.  If you have the music professionally engraved, you don't have to worry about most of this, but if you do it yourself, then you do.  You should also keep in mind how binding will work, what kind of paper you'll use, etc.  When I write music for my a cappella group, I don't need to worry about all that, but the conventions for instrumental music are different and generally involve bigger paper as well, not the 8.5"x11" format popular in the US (similar to the European A4).  Scores are generally printed on oversize paper (otherwise they're way too small for anyone to read), and nothing is ever standard.</p>
<p class="text">Also on the checklist: cues and parts for less common instruments.  They're not necessary, but they can be useful.  In a large ensemble, like an orchestra, you could have some instrumentation be optional.  Maybe you expect that some ensembles will have a contrabass clarinet and some won't, and you want your music to be playable regardless.  A high-level wind orchestra <em>will</em> have a contrabass clarinet if you specify it in the score, even if an external player has to be hired for the performance to fill in the part.  A less high-level wind orchestra, or one with fewer resources, won't have a contra clarinet player.  If your music doesn't make specific use of the contra clarinet, which is not all that common an instrument in the first place, then you'll need to have parts for a contra player to read, even if they simply double the tuba most of the time (contra parts are generally not the most exciting music ever written).  On the other hand, if your music <em>does</em> make specific use of the contra clarinet, then you may want to write cues in another part (like the tuba part) so that someone else can cover that wicked contra solo.  Believe it or not, I've heard an example.  Frank Ticheli's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNUui99aSNc">Blue Shades</a> is famous for its clarinet and bass clarinet solos, and it even has a little feature for the contrabass clarinet (in that video, it happens at 5:55 between bass clarinet solos).  But in Spring 2014, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgusuKkueso">UNC Wind Ensemble</a> apparently didn't have a contra clarinet, so the feature is played by the tuba (6:12).  I personally think the contra clarinet sounds <em>much</em> better than the tuba on that solo (and I love the sound of the tuba in general), but with the cues, the piece is at least still playable if a contra player can't be obtained for the performance.  Cues are also useful for people to have an easier time counting during rests or just to fill in parts during rehearsal when a soloist is missing for whatever reason.</p>
<h4 class="question">Holy shit, that piece.  Wow.</h4>
<p class="text">I know, right?  I actually played the clarinet solo on this piece when I was in high school.  We definitely didn't sound as good as the North Texas Wind Symphony, but we played the shit out of that song.  We rocked it at district festival.  We rocked it at state festival.  Then I <em>completely</em> fucked up at the band's final concert.  I don't think I've ever fucked anything up that badly before or after.  It was a spectacle, and it was all my fault there.</p>
<p class="text">It's worth looking at the composition of the piece a little bit, while we're at it.  Again, I don't know nor claim to know what went on through Frank Ticheli's mind as he composed it, but we can see a couple of things.  First, immediately when the song starts, you get a descending minor third: Ab - F.  It repeats a bunch of times, and eventually new themes and motifs come in but they keep hammering that minor third.  Another obvious aspect is that there's a kind of focus on New Orleans jazz.  It's not actual jazz, but quite a few jazz idioms are present, mostly in the form of clarinet solos.  In real jazz they'd be improvised, but here they're written out and meticulously timed; there's no improvisation in Blue Shades.  The blues scale is specifically featured, not all the time but pretty close.  The common effect in blues music of a blues scale melody over a major harmony is actually inverted here; we hear a bass melody in minor while the higher instruments play harmony in major, creating polymodality.  There's a lot of chromaticism, but there's also a lot of the blues scale.  The "blue" of "Blue Shades" actually refers to this, according to the program notes for this piece.  Actually, you may want to just <a href="http://www.manhattanbeachmusic.com/html/blue_shades.html">read over those program notes yourself</a>; Ticheli does a better job of analyzing his own compositional thought process than I ever could!  In particular, relevant to this section of the chapter, he says: "The final stroke on the splash cymbal reminds the listener that this piece is, above all, a friendly tribute to an earlier style. The splash cymbal must be small (6 to 8 inches) to give the tongue-in-cheek effect. This final cliché should elicit a chuckle from the audience."  The ending section in general is referred to in these program notes as a "final shout", and it reprises the previous climax but in a different way.  The piece ends with a long chord and a quick choke of a splash cymbal, because Ticheli wants the audience to experience a comic effect at the end of the song.  It's a fitting ending, I think, because there are some <em>seriously</em> high-energy moments earlier in the piece, and the comic effect of the splash cymbal helps dissipate all that tension in the listener.</p>
<p class="text">So long as you don't knock over a music stand holding a bunch of mallets and complement the sound of the splash cymbal with the sound of percussion equipment hitting the stage.  Yep, that happened at state festival.</p>
<h4 class="question">Oof.  Kinda ruins the effect a bit, doesn't it?</h4>
<p class="text">Kinda does.</p>

<h3 class="subsection-title" id="case-study">8.3.4 Case Study</h3>

<p class="text">To finish off this section of the chapter, I'd like to talk about the compositional thought process for something I actually know: one of my own pieces, <a href="http://www.offtonic.com/music/brass.php#haikai">Hai-Kai</a>'s first movement.  We looked at this piece in <? sectionLinkShort('composition genre study'); ?>, so hopefully it's familiar.  The recording is synthesized, so it's important here to look past the sound quality.  In my own program notes, I talk a bit about the piece; I wrote a little poem, called a haikai, in the pursuit of a Brazilian three-movement suite for brass sextet (as required by the competition to which I submitted the piece; alas, it did not win).  A haiku traditionally has a 5-7-5 syllabic structure, but that's really just one way to interpret the poetic genre, and modern haiku poetry may deviate from that prescription.  In Brazil, the word used to describe this type of poetry is "haikai" (which in Japanese is actually a superset of haiku), hence my choice of title.  There's a particular pattern to the natural descriptions that are the usual subjects of a haiku, where something is still in the first line, something is moving in the second line, and something is of "eternal significance" (as my 11th grade AP English teacher described it) in the third.  So I wrote something in Portuguese with syllable counts 5-7-6, translating to "The morning sky/Shines on the ocean/Paints it blue".  And hey, if the syllable counts are 5, 7, and 6, I could do the first movement in 5/8, the second in 7/8, and the third in 6/8!  So I did.  And then I started actually trying to write music.</p>
<p class="text">A few years earlier, I submitted <a href="http://offtonic.com/music/brass.php#tower">Tower</a> to the same competition, and I actually won one of the prizes (with prize money).  Then I submitted <a href="http://offtonic.com/music/brass.php#toseph">To Sepharad</a>, and that didn't win.  I figured it was because Tower had more musical sophistication as To Sepharad was fairly simple, so I wanted Hai-Kai to be as musically sophisticated as I could.  This meant... polyphony!  Tower had lots of polyphony.  To Sepharad had less.  But... what the hell was I going to actually write?  I had a name, some notion that the movement was going to be in 5/8, the instrumentation, and... literally nothing else.  No ideas.  But it was a morning sky, right?  How can I depict a morning sky?  For some reason, a melody going 5 - 5 - 1 (the 1 being a fourth above the 5, not a fifth below) is very morning-y.  It's even how Taps starts, right?  So I put that in the first trumpet.  I want polyphony, so I gave the second trumpet a transposed version, and then the trombone another transposed version.  Trumpet/trumpet/trombone is a nice bright-sounding sub-choir in a brass choir, as opposed to the beautifully dark horn/euphonium/tuba matching; I use that choir later, but in the beginning I stick with the trumpet/trumpet/trombone through a continuation of the melody using kinda dissonant Brazilian-sounding chords (based on my earlier studies of Brazilian music).</p>
<p class="text">We're going to analyze the whole piece, bit by bit.  I've condensed the score to just two staves so that it's easier to read (most of the time), noted the chord symbols, and colored in the motifs.  If you haven't already, let's listen to it first (it's useful to have another tab open with the recording so that you can follow along more easily).  This is Hai-Kai, movement I, O céu da manhã (The morning sky):</p>

<? createExample('Hai-Kai I'); ?>

<h4 class="question">That was pretty.  But it was kind of incomprehensible, too.</h4>
<p class="text">A little.  We'll de-mystify that with the score, starting with the introduction to the piece:</p>

<? createExample('Hai-Kai I intro'); ?>

<h4 class="question">Ooh, pretty colors!</h4>
<p class="text">That's right.  I added these colors to highlight the different motifs used in this piece.  There are basically only two main rhythmic motifs (and a few secondary ones); the quarter eighth quarter motif and the five eighths motif.  In bar 1 we see the very first motif, quarter eighth quarter where the second note is the same as the first and the third note is higher, highlighted in the color Apple calls "blueberry" (apparently it's just regular blue, but whatever).  In bar 4 we see the second; this particular shape of the five eighth notes gets colored "grape".  The grape motif is generally followed by the quarter eighth quarter motif in bar 5, which is more of a rhythm than a melody; the rhythm is the same as the blueberry motif but since every note is the same, this one gets colored "moss".  Finally, in bar 9, we just have a chord, so that's non-motivic material and it's not colored in any special way.  We will see these motifs show up again and again, hence the colors.</p>
<h4 class="question">Why will they keep showing up again and again?</h4>
<p class="text">Two reasons.  First, because coming up with new material is hard, but remixing old material is easy.  Second, because new material is confusing to listeners, but old material is comforting.  These two reasons are why composing a piece like this one is not actually very difficult.  When you hear it, it sounds so complex, but it's really not!</p>
<p class="text">I mentioned earlier that I actually won prize money with my previous submission to the competition from two years prior, and that first movement was kind of abstract and had a slow intro.  The year before I submitted Hai-Kai, the piece did not win, and it had very clear melodies and a fast intro.  So I figured I'd do the abstract piece with slow intro thing again, and you see that right here.  The opening is a very clear perfect fourth in bar 1.  Nice.  Bar 2, I want to echo that because I'm writing this piece polyphonically, but I also want it to be a little atonal so I don't echo it with a perfect fifth — the tonal answer, switching authentic and plagal — or a perfect fourth — the real answer, keeping the same intervals but up or down a fifth — but instead with a tritone.  Right away, you know that this piece is going to be a bit dissonant.  That's a very conscious choice.  The trombone in bar 3 is a third answer, but this one is a perfect fourth again.  These notes were chosen to match the melody I imagined in my head and still be dissonant.  There was a <em>lot</em> of trial and error here, by the way.  I started this piece over several times before I figured out something I liked.</p>
<p class="text">Bar 4 we get our first new motif.  It just sounded right to me.  The chords look complicated, but I honestly didn't think about them while I was writing.  I just found a sound I liked and moved it in parallel within the Dbsus pentatonic scale (Db Eb Gb Ab Cb).</p>
<h4 class="question">That's a whole lot of flats.  What's the point?</h4>
<p class="text">You know, I don't remember.  I feel like I must have written this in D for a while instead of Db and taken it down a step when I realized there'd be too many sharps, and I may not have considered that now there were too many flats.  It's not all that bad for trumpets, though, since they're in Bb and read everything a whole step higher; they only get 3 flats in the key signature (horn only gets 4).</p>
<p class="text">The chord at 5 is kind of the natural resolution of the parallel chords from the previous bar.  I didn't like the way it sounded with the trombone on F, but you get a nice sus chord with it on Db, so I did that.  The piece is kinda in Db, so this is the tonic chord.  The grape motif repeats in 6, but this time the resolution at 7 is still parallel, because I liked that sound, and Bbm7 is the relative minor.  In measure 8 I bring in the other instruments with the same notes as in measure 4 (just down the octave), while the initial motif from measure 1 comes back in the trumpets and trombone to give this section a feel of conclusion, ending on an ambiguous 11th chord.</p>
<h4 class="question">Why did you use this chord?</h4>
<p class="text">If you look at the horn, euphonium, and tuba at 8 and 9, they have exactly the same notes as the trumpets and trombone do at 4 and 5, just an octave down.  Trumpet 1 has Eb to F at 8, which logically continues to Gb at 9.  That gives us Db Eb Ab Gb.  What other notes go with these four?  Cb works, since we've been using the Db Eb Gb Ab Cb pentatonic scale already.  That's what trumpet 2 does.  The trombone then just doubles the root.  Easy enough!</p>
<p class="text">When I wrote this, I had recently read Mark Levine's Jazz Theory Book, so I tried to use some of the concepts I learned there.  The main thing I used is the idea that you can stick pretty much anything into a chord, so you'll see a lot of these complex chords basically just because there's no reason not to use them here.  I didn't think, "hm, I should use a 13th chord here!"; rather, I thought, "what notes can I add to this chord that fit the voice leading?"  My default when writing this piece was to write the melodic voices, figure out a bass to go with them, and fill in the rest of the parts with whatever sounded good (generally the 9th and 6th/13th, sometimes 7th; the 4th/11th usually doesn't sound as nice).  Composing on the computer gives you the chance for rapid feedback, so you can write something listen to it, decide you don't like it, and change it to something else, try again, etc.  Your imagination provides the seed, but then you go and adjust stuff until you're happy with it.</p>
<p class="text">Let's continue on with the piece:</p>

<? createExample('Hai-Kai I A'); ?>

<p class="text">We start off with two voices, horn and tuba.  The tuba is just outlining chords; this is a motif that only the tuba has throughout the piece, which you probably wouldn't even realize is there without looking at the score.  Measure 10 has it going up, and measure 11 has it inverted.  The one going up is colored in a dark gray called "steel", and the inverted version is colored in a lighter gray called "nickel".  I've tried to be somewhat consistent in coloring inverted motifs in a lighter color from the original.  At 14 there's a variation colored "aluminum", and at 15 its inversion, in "silver".  Again, these are Apple crayon colors that I chose from because it was convenient.  Meanwhile, the horn has a little melody based on the grape theme at 10.  This is something that was probably a mistake, because I never actually bothered to develop this melody.  Measures 10 and 11 show up throughout, but 12, a variant of the motif of 10 colored in "plum", does not appear anywhere else.  At 11 we also get introduced to the inversion of the blueberry motif, here in "aqua".  The blueberry motif and the aqua motif (together, since they're just mirror images of each other) are the primary motif of the piece.</p>
<p class="text">This bit of the piece is really nothing more than me noodling around, trying to fill time.  I should probably have replaced it with something better, but here's the thing.  When I write music, I very often don't know what I want to write next.  I start from the beginning and I keep writing until I get to the end, but I don't know what to do at each step.  This is probably bad practice, because the end result is that the material at the beginning of the piece is less developed, and at the end of the piece it's more thought-out.  So when I was trying to write the music at letter C, for example, I wouldn't know what to write next, so I'd listen to the entire piece so far for inspiration, including this section here at the beginning of A.  I got used to it.  After a while, it becomes part of the music; you can't change it without destroying the piece.  Maybe stuff like this is why it didn't win.</p>
<p class="text">Another tendency I have — and it's fairly common in music — is to start simple and add complexity over the course of... a phrase, a piece, whatever.  Here at A, we have five bars with just horn and tuba, and then more people come in at 15.  THe standard formula in a fugue is to have entrances be the fugue subject, so here, since the melody begins with the horn on the grape motif, when the trombone and euphonium come in at 15, they do so on the grape motif.  The chords here are the same as in the intro, except that the tuba has its own thing, changing the bass of the chords and recontextualizing them with a different root.  The trumpets come in at 16 before the other guys are done, which in fugal contexts is known as a <em>stretto</em>, with their own variation on the grape motif, and then something happens at 17.</p>
<h4 class="question">The piece becomes different!</h4>
<p class="text">It does.  If I had known I was going to do 17 from the start, 10-16 would have been very different (but I like the intro).  At 17, I introduce a kind of pause in the momentum of the piece thus far; instead of a melody moving forward, I now have some chords.  This first chord is roughly an extension of the material in the previous bar, but I liked the possibilities.  I decided after a few tries to turn the beat around, going from 3+2 to 2+3, as a kind of not-quite-syncopation.  That's why the second quarter note is accented.  I gave this new rhythmic motif a new color, "spring", and I include any resolution in the next bar as part of the spring motif (we'll see that later).  The spring motif is another major idea in the piece, and it's what I talked about several paragraphs ago: many-note chords in homophonic rhythm.</p>
<h4 class="question">What?  How can a rhythm be homophobic?</h4>
<p class="text">No, it's <em>homophonic</em>.  That means that all of the parts have the same rhythm.  Contrast <em>monophonic</em>, where every part is playing the same notes, and <em>heterophonic</em>, where every part is playing roughly the same melody but with different ornamentation.</p>
<p class="text">In our case, the rhythm is the star.  Think of it like strumming all of the strings of a guitar in rhythm as opposed to doing some sort of finger-style playing like a lot of Brazilian music tends to be.  Actually, this bit was vaguely inspired by a guitar piece called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X88_ydZuKZs">Pixaim</a>, by Marco Pereira.</p>
<h4 class="question">...I don't see the resemblance.  At all.</h4>
<p class="text">Lots of complex chords and rhythms?  I think.  Here's the thing.  I think I had only heard the piece once at that point, and I wasn't even paying close attention.  So I was vaguely influenced by what I thought I heard, which was random complex chords on the guitar.  There are some of those at the end of the piece.  I wasn't trying to <em>reproduce</em> it; I just liked the chords and rhythms!  This is how influences work.  You hear something and try to incorporate it into your work, but in your own voice.</p>
<p class="text">That's what I did at 17.  I turned this polyphonic brass piece with long notes into a rhythmic guitar piece.  17 and 18, then, like 20 and 21, have complex chords (figured out by trial and error) and this guitar-appropriate rhythm.  Measure 19 is a filler between them, here in a variant of the grape motif that I colored in "lavender".  I chose the chords based on the trumpet 1 and tuba parts; 17 and 18 are just i - bII in Bb minor (the relative minor of the main key of the piece, Db), and 20 and 21 are i - bvii.  The piece is mostly in Db mixolydian, but here in these four measures it's in Bb phrygian (measure 19 is back to Db mixolydian, though).  I don't think I was thinking of these keys when I was writing the piece.  I was just hearing melodies and bass lines, and I filled in the chords with whatever worked.  The trumpet 1 part in 17-18 goes down, and in 20-21 it goes up.  The deal here is that the second one is kind of an answer to the first, so it has to be different.</p>
<p class="text">Notice, by the way, the notes in each chord.  I'm going to go scale-wise from the bass.  17 and 20 have Bb Bb Cb Db F Ab; 18 has Cb Cb Db Eb Gb Ab; 21 has Ab Ab Bb Cb Eb Gb.  From the Bb phrygian scale, Bb Cb Db Eb F Gb Ab, each of these chords takes five notes (and doubles the bass).  All of them skip the 4th; the chord at 17 and 20 skips the 13th, the chord at 18 skips the 7th, and the chord at 21 skips the 13th as well.  Why?  The 13th can be a bit hard to work with, too melodically active.  Many chords also don't need both a 7th and a 13th, hence all the 6/9 chords in this piece.  The 7th adds a lot of tension to major and dominant chords, so when you want the complexity without that tension, the 6/9 is a great way to do it.  The dominant 11th, skipping the 3rd, is also a nice way to achieve this goal.  Really, the problem is with the third and the seventh interacting in ways that steal attention from the rest of the chord.  That's why it's often said that the most important notes in a chord are the root, third, and seventh, but if you do skip them, the resulting chord can be very useful.  We'll see much more of these chords later in the piece.</p>
<p class="text">I didn't think I could do something similar to 19 after 21, because I didn't want to go back to the complex rhythmic chords right away, so I put a variation of that motif in the euphonium, here colored in "magenta".  This variation is going to come up many times.  I use it here in this transitional segment from 22 to 24, going up in pitch each time, to a big landing at B (below).  The other voices just have parallel chords going up, except trumpet 2 with some filler and a scale going up.  I don't consider this to be motivic material, and that's fine.  It's there because I wanted to achieve a specific effect, so it doesn't need to be motivic.  Bach fugues are famous for being very motivic, but you'll find plenty of other material there too.</p>
<p class="text">Let's see where this transition is taking us:</p>

<? createExample('Hai-Kai I B'); ?>

<h4 class="question">Whoa!  New key!</h4>
<p class="text">Yeah!  We're in D mixolydian now!  Where did this come from?  The scalar lines in the transition in 22-24 were basically warped a little bit so that landing here would make sense.  This piece doesn't give a very strong sense of tonality, so the key change doesn't even really come as some sort of surprise, but it does keep things a bit fresher.  The voice leading wasn't even that smooth, which I think is not a problem at all here.</p>
<p class="text">This first bit here at 25 is kind of new, but not really.  The rhythm is the same as the moss motif from earlier, but since it's used here on the rhythmic complex chords instead of in a melody, I figured it should get a new — but almost identical — color, "clover".  No, I can't tell the difference either.  I consider the clover motif to resolve on the downbeat of the next bar (and I allow the spring motif to do the same), so the first chord at 26, 28, and 32 are each considered (by me) to be part of the motif of the preceding bar.  The filler at 19 was a full bar, but we don't have time for that here, so there's a new filler, a mostly scalar run in 16th notes (with an articulation that's hopefully not too difficult to actually play), which I colored in "mocha".  The same logic went into the chords here that went into the chords in the A section; I wrote the outer voices and stuck in notes in between that made it sound good, again with a preference for 6/9 chords.  Except it's major here instead of minor.  Major chords tend to be 6/9's, while minor chords tend to be m9's and dominant chords tend to be 13's.  That's just the way I wrote them, not some overarching principle of harmony, but I do think they sound good that way.  Feel free to disagree.</p>
<p class="text">This whole section is basically rhythmic chords with filler in between, at least until 41.  Notice how in many of these chords, the notes don't move; from 30 to 31, for example, the upper three voices stay the same, the euphonium and trombone move by a semitone each, and only the tuba really jumps to the new root.  29 to 32 is also one of the more functional passages when it comes to harmony; we have D - F - Bb7 - Eb; the latter three chords form a II - V7 - I in Eb, and D to F is a chromatic mediant relationship.  From 25 to 29 we're solidly in D, and then we modulate up to Eb in a very natural way.  I don't think I did that consciously, to be honest.  I definitely did the II - V7 - I on purpose, but I wasn't thinking about keys at all.  Also, the phrase structure is important here: rhythm, filler, rhythm, filler, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, filler.  It's fairly symmetric.  The rhythm at 31 is the spring rhythm rather than the clover rhythm, but it just feels like a variation rather than a new thing, which is why they're both shades of green.</p>
<p class="text">At 33, we do something similar, but this time it takes 5 measures rather than 8.  The nice thing about composing with short motifs instead of longer melodies is that you don't have to worry too much that your phrase lengths are too monotonous!  This time, the filler is the magenta motif in the second trumpet with the nickel motif in the tuba.  That motif helps establish the harmony; the D natural at 36 is especially important to tell us that something harmonically interesting is going on here.  The chord at 34 is actually pretty interesting.  The melody and harmony are roughly independent, so two features from earlier get repeated here in odd ways.  25 and 26, the melody goes up a whole step and the bass goes down a whole step.  From D and E, we get C and F#.  Has to be a #11 chord, then, right?  At 33, the melody has a C because that's what the melody was in the previous chord, and the harmony has an Ab because I wanted the IV chord there.  C goes up to D, Ab goes down to Gb, and now I have a chord with Gb and D.  It's gotta be an augmented chord!  I added stuff to it, so it's a Gb9#5 rather than just a Gb+, but it's still an augmented chord at heart.</p>
<p class="text">The D natural kind of doesn't go with the Ab major chord, so at 37 we get to see both, the Ab major chord and the D, combined.  The tuba and euphonium exchange bits of the mocha motif — why those instruments?  Because they have valves.  The trombone has a slide, so it's harder to play fast notes.</p>
<h4 class="question">Why do they switch off?  For the effect?</h4>
<p class="text">For playability, actually.  You see, playing those fast notes is <em>hard</em>.  It's <em>possible</em>, unlike on the trombone, but it's not easy.  The humane thing to do is to split the run between multiple instruments, so you get the whole run in parts.  The chord in the second half of bar 37 is essentially incidental rather than a purposeful harmony, unlike the first chord at 37.  Trumpet 1 and horn at 37 have the blueberry motif from the first bar of the piece with the same notes, which is a big callback, and this is the kind of thing that anchors the listener.  You hear that Ab Ab Db and it solidifies all of the other times you've heard those same notes in this piece.</p>
<p class="text">There's another cool thing happening here, and this one came later.  After I wrote the notes, I realized that I should probably make some dynamics, and I was tired of all the bombast of the big rhythmic chords, so I did the opposite of what one might expect: pianissimo at 33.  Sure, it gets back to forte at 38, but I find it a nice way to build interest.  When you want to make a piece more interesting, just play with the dynamics a bit.  It's OK to make things soft; too loud all the time gets tiring.</p>
<p class="text">At 38 we have more rhythm and filler, this time in the tuba.  The melody still goes up a whole step the first time and a third the second time, though here it's a major third because the harmony is ii - V7 (in Eb major) and that's the note that fits.  But notice the Gb in the euphonium filler at 41.  Again, that note announces a change in harmony.  The magenta filler this time continues into a melody with the aqua motif (we'll see that many times, two aqua motifs after a motif with five eighth notes).  That change in harmony happens with a fairly short transition into what ends up being a kind of F locrian run in the horn.  The downward scalar runs of 16th notes are colored "brown" (not an Apple crayon color, just a regular Apple color), a lighter version of the upward scalar run color of mocha.</p>
<p class="text">This transition goes into this:</p>

<? createExample('Hai-Kai I C'); ?>

<p class="text">I thought, at this point, something like: "Oh, right, I was going to make this polyphonic and atonal; I better add a fugue with a really angular subject."  So that's what I did here.  A melody is <em>angular</em> if it's filled with jumps going up and down that don't form neat chords, and that's what this is.  The motif is actually six notes, but since the sixth note is part of an aqua motif, I just colored the first five notes in... "maraschino".  It's not exactly red, but close enough, right?  Since I was trying to be somewhat atonal, I didn't pay a lot of attention to the intervals, only to the direction of motion.  So you see that the first interval in the horn and trombone is a P5, but in the trumpet it's a P4.  The interval across the bar line is an m7 in the horn and trumpet, but it's a D5 in the trombone.  The intervals serve the interests of the harmony.</p>
<p class="text">This section gets a bit annoying, unfortunately, due to all the Fb's and Bbb's that come up.  They're also not entirely consistent; the A natural at 46 should have been a Bbb (which I marked in the chord symbol).  If I were writing this today, I'd probably have done many things differently.</p>
<p class="text">It does codify a usage of motifs that wasn't quite pronounced before; we see it at 46, 48, 50, 55, and 56.  There's some chord on the first beat and some other chord on the second beat, and all of the voices are blueberry or aqua motifs depending on whether they go up or down (or moss if neither).  We saw something similar at 37, but the inner voices there were chromatic, not aqua/blueberry, so it doesn't count.  This is the beginning of the prominence of these two motifs.  Again, if I had done more pre-composition, I probably would have put these guys earlier, but once I start writing the piece I start <em>liking</em> what I've written so far and I don't want to cut it.  Personal flaw, I guess.</p>
<p class="text">A new motif gets introduced at 49, the 16th note noodling motif, in "cayenne".  The previous 16th note motifs were scales; this is when the 16th notes aren't so much in a scale.  I had considered not coloring it at all, but it's a compositional element that I revisit later, so it's probably good to keep track of it.</p>
<p class="text">In this section, there are generally many things happening at once, and the motif colors I think make it easy to see that.  The first five bars, we just have the fugue subject in several parts at the same time, but at 50, we add back the lavender motif, and the upper instruments at 51 and 52 are kind of finishing out their bit while the tuba and euphonium play around below.  There's some interesting writing here: I love the tuba playing high.  Seriously, it's great.  People put the tuba in the bass all the time, but the tuba has a beautiful upper range that gets under-utilized.  So at 51 I have the tuba above the euphonium and trombone, and the tuba only comes back down at 54.  Just because the tuba <em>can</em> play low doesn't mean that it needs to do that <em>all</em> the time, right?  Meanwhile I'm just repeating the motifs, lavender and maraschino and aqua, which is actually pretty easy to do if you've played enough Bach.  Need a new thing?  Just have one of the voices start the subject again.  At 50, then, we have the euphonium doing the lavender motif as a kind of filler, while the bass does the subject (maraschino + aqua + aqua).  Then, at 53, the euphonium takes up the subject again, and trumpet 2 does the same thing at 54.  Meanwhile, the music builds, and when the music builds, what happens?  A big cadence or hit of some sort, right?</p>
<p class="text">That hit happens at 57.  The aqua/blueberry chords at 56 are reminiscent of the spring and moss chords from earlier, but those motifs have one chord for the entire bar, while here the chord changes halfway through.  Those chords at 56 resolve to 57, which is a measure of the filler from earlier.  That filler is now a repeatable motif, and it happens again with a different chord at 58.  How did I come up with this?  Again, it's just whatever sounds good at the time.  This analysis that I'm doing now is <em>very</em> ex post facto.  The odd thing is that instead of rhythm rhythm rhythm filler, we have filler filler rhythm filler.  59 is the spring motif again, and 60 has a variation on the grape motif, which is still colored grape based on the first three notes.</p>
<p class="text">The chords at 59 and 60 are very unresolved.  The key... doesn't really exist anymore, but the chord at 60 is clearly a dominant chord in search of a resolution, a D7 looking for a Gm.  The chord at 61 is not <em>exactly</em> a Gm, but it's close enough; Eø7 is equivalent to Gm/E.  The only instrument not playing the Gm chord is the tuba.  That's enough for the resolution to not be convincing, and 61-63 builds to a climax.  We'll get to that in a moment.  61 has an interesting event: the maraschino motif is articulated very consistently: da-ah da-ah da-ah.  Here at 61, though, it's staccato eighths in the second trumpet, which contrasts with the magenta motif in the trombone.  The magenta motif repeats a step higher in the next bar, raising the tension, while the maraschino motif continues with the aqua motif, but the chord here is a Gbo7, a bit awkward after the Eø7.  That Gb should <em>probably</em> be an F#, but since we're not staying in G minor it doesn't matter.</p>
<p class="text">Just for reference, I don't think it's very important, but I colored the upwards eighth note scale at 63 in "eggplant" (very close to black, but whatever) and the downwards scale in purple (not a crayon color, just a regular color).  They come up again later, but they're more of an effect than a motif.</p>
<p class="text">And the climax:</p>

<? createExample('Hai-Kai I D'); ?>

<h4 class="question">Sun?</h4>
<p class="text">The morning sky's gotta have a sun in it, right?  When I was "planning" this movement, I wanted it to be more or less homogeneous but with a big warm bright moment in it to represent the sun, and that's here at letter D.  We've modulated around a bit, but we're finally back to our home key of Db.  The trumpets and horn (second trumpet on top because that's just how it came out) do the aqua motif but with clear Db major triads; the trombone and euphonium have the 6 and 9 of the chord, but the stuff you hear together is the Db major triad.  There aren't a lot of those in the piece, which is why this one stands out as being bright to the point of blaring.  This moment is followed up by a tower chord at 65 while the horn plays the maraschino motif on the Db major scale (rather than the angular and atonal version in the original statement of the motif).</p>
<h4 class="question">What's a tower chord?</h4>
<p class="text">Ah, that's just when you have many instruments playing a chord but they don't start at the same time.  You can see that it's tuba on the downbeat, then trombone the second eighth note, euphonium the third, trumpet 2 the fourth, and trumpet 1 the fifth, though trumpet 1 follows that with the grape motif while the horn does the two aquas in a row.  Meanwhile, the rest of the instruments do the spring motif at 65.  We have three different things going on at once, which is exciting!  At 67, the horn continues with the aqua while everyone else does a tower chord again (in a different voicing), and then trumpets 1 and 2 have a grape motif thing like at the start of the piece over the spring motif in the other instruments.  The whole thing ends at 69, where the first trumpet again repeats the first notes of the piece as the intensity is dialed down.  This isn't meant to be a very long climax — don't stare at the sun, after all!  There's a cute little thing at 69 that's a bit difficult to see in the condensed score: everyone's at <em><strong>p</strong></em> except trumpet 2, at <em><strong>mf</strong></em>.  Writing different dynamics for different instruments, especially when one has a crescendo and another has a diminuendo, is sometimes referred to as <em>Grainger dynamics</em> because of Percy Grainger's propensity to use the device, but in general it should be reserved for special effects, because it's much easier to play at the same dynamic as everyone else.  I did that here only because I wanted the second trumpet to have the melody even though it's not the top voice.  Why not keep the melody in the top voice?  Variety.  You may come into composition with some idea for the roles that various instruments play in the ensemble, but the music will be boring if you don't vary it up!</p>
<p class="text">At 70, the sun moment is gone, and there's just some cayenne noodling between the trumpets and horn for a few bars.  I wasn't sure how to follow the sun, so I just did something different until, at 72, I got the opportunity to bring back the motifs I'd been using, with the horn in the aqua (playing quite high for the horn, actually) and tuba in the maraschino.  There's just kinda random motivic stuff going on, because once you've established motifs, you can use them as filler.  (Also, once you've established filler, you can use it as motifs.  It goes both ways.)  One interesting bit, because why not, is the second trumpet at 73, playing an <em>inverted</em> maraschino motif, which I've colored in "salmon".  This is the only time I used it.  I probably should have dropped it in more often, because I like the idea and the maraschino motif is distinctive enough that it's still recognizable in inversion.</p>
<p class="text">At 74, the second trumpet has something <em>similar</em> to the very beginning of the piece, but it's warped, just like the trumpet 2 entrance way back in bar 2.  Instead of Ab Ab Db, the part goes Ab Ab D.  Over the next few bars, instruments drop out and it's kind of like letting the air out of the band; the chords get weirder and thinner.  This is actually a transition into the next section.  To be honest, I don't really like how this transition sounds.  I'm much better at making music build than making it deflate, and it shows.  My music tends to reach some climax and then kind of suddenly get small again, and once I start with a rhythm it's hard to stop.  A hit, where most instruments in the ensemble have a short downbeat followed by nothing (like in measures 70, 71, and 72), is an easy opportunity for a change of pace, but I'm just bad at doing it gradually.  When you're composing, it's useful to know your strengths and weaknesses.  That only comes from experience, but it turns out you don't really need a lot of it.  One mediocre composition is enough for you to learn a lot about your tendencies.  I don't think Hai-Kai is mediocre; I really like it.  I've written music that I'm far less proud of.  But it's good to be honest about its flaws.</p>

<? createExample('Hai-Kai I E'); ?>

<h4 class="question">Is that... the intro again?  It's weird.</h4>
<p class="text">It is, but with a twist!  Several twists!  First, the rhythm has been stretched!  This is known as <em>augmentation</em>.  The actual intro is slow, but I'm not changing the tempo here, so I made the note values longer instead.  It's not exactly proportional; quarter eighth quarter becomes dotted quarter quarter dotted quarter tied to quarter, so, in eighth notes, 2 1 2 becomes 3 2 5.  If it had been proportional, it would have been 4 2 4, but it's not.  I like it that way.  Other than the different note in the first trumpet at 78 (the measure before E), which is written as a B natural but should probably have been a Cb, the beginning of the intro here is identical to the original intro except for the augmentation.</p>
<p class="text">But at 84, we get our second twist: our slow intro is punctuated by fast rhythmic chords.  And this rhythm is new!  The tuba has the nickel motif, just articulated differently, but the horn, euphonium, and trombone don't.  This is a new phenomenon in the piece; I've used rhythmic chords, but they were very specific rhythms, generally one chord to the bar unless I was doing aqua/blueberry stuff.  Here, though, I'm using bossa nova rhythms in a jazzier way, so I've colored these usages in "sky".  The sky motif is not a specific rhythm; it's just general rhythmic chords that don't fit the other motifs and are possibly more in the background.  We'll see them more.</p>
<p class="text">At 85 and 89, the intro continues, almost exactly as before; the grape motif didn't get augmented, but the moss motif did at 86 and 87.  Again, we get punctuation at 88.  The punctuation at 92 is special, though: it's an eighth note late!  That actually throws things off, and we're not ready for the downbeat of 93.  I like the fact that things get thrown off, but I don't like not being ready for 93, so maybe I should have used a different rhythm at 92.</p>
<h4 class="question">Why did you repeat the intro?</h4>
<p class="text">Because it's familiar.  We've already heard it before, and now we're hearing it again, so you already know how it's going to go.  Except it's different this time.  When I repeated the intro here, I figured I'd do more of a recap, but since I never really had a development section, the music felt lopsided.  The fact is that the actual intro is slow, but this recap <em>sounds</em> slow but still has its fast momentum.  The actual intro stops at measure 9 and just holds a chord, so letter A starts of its own accord.  I couldn't do that here.  So after 92, instead of the last two bars of the intro, we go into something else:</p>

<? createExample('Hai-Kai I F'); ?>

<p class="text">The horn motif here, colored "carnation", is essentially an inversion of the grape motif, at least in the first three notes.  This part is pretty normal, given the piece, but the new thing is happening in the other instruments, which are now doing bossa nova rhythms in the background — the sky motif.  This is the first time in the piece that there has been a melody playing over chords instead of polyphony.  Why?  I probably shouldn't have done that, actually.  But I like the result, and I used it as a motif in the other two movements.  In a way, the sky motif separates the first half of the piece from the second half.</p>
<p class="text">There's not much more to say about this section, except that I clearly felt like I was building up to something.  Other than the sky motif, the writing is actually quite polyphonic.  Horn does carnation for three bars then aqua for two; trumpet 1 does maraschino for a bar then aqua for three; euphonium does maraschino then aqua for two; horn does maraschino then aqua for two; trumpet 1 does maraschino then blueberry for one.  There's also some structure to this transition section; measures 93 to 98 have motivic stuff over sky rhythms, resolving in blueberry/aqua at 99; 100 and 101 do the same and finish with blueberry/aqua at 102, but this time it's very much not a resolution but a lead-in to the next bit:</p>

<? createExample('Hai-Kai I G'); ?>

<p class="text">It's a shout!  It's a great ending, I think; very energetic!  Everyone comes together for some fun rhythmic chords.  Only problem is, it's too early for the piece to end, so measure 115 has to happen.  I wrote this and thought, oh, great, done with the first movement!  But then I listened to it, and... the ending was too soon.  I could delay the ending, or I could... make it not the ending.  I chose that.  This whole shout section is a <em>false ending</em>, where you think it's going to end but it doesn't.  The real ending later on is very similar to this section.</p>
<p class="text">The rhythms are essentially random, but the chords are not.  If you excuse my misspellings, we have essentially a circle of fifths here.  Well.  Maybe not.  The second chord is not very functional, having little relation to the chords around it.  But it sounds awesome.  I don't remember how I came up with it, actually, but I really like it.  The chords after that make more sense; you have Gb7 - Cb (V7 - I), Fb7 - Bbb (V7 - I again), but then Ab7 to Db.  The Cb is the V of Fb, so that part is from a circle of fifths, but Bbb - Ab7 - Db is actually bVI - V7 - I, a perfectly good cadence in major.  We then get more filler in the tuba and euphonium as the V7 - I chords get repeated, and at 114 we get the final cadence of the section, which is a ii - bII - I.  This bII is known as a <em>tritone substitution</em>; we'll talk about those later, but the gist is that instead of ii - V - I you do ii - bII - I, substituting the V chord for the chord a tritone away, the bII.  This works for various reasons, which we'll talk about... eventually.  I just have to say, I found the notes to add to the bII chord, the EbbM13#5 (what a mouthful; no wonder I spelled it with D's instead of Ebb's), by trial and error.  You may well have been wondering what kind of genius I must be to use this chord, but the answer is that I tried different notes until I found something I liked.  I labeled it a Bbb7alt, but that's because the full chord symbol was too big.  The notes here (enharmonically) are A C C# D# G, making this an A7b5#9, or, more properly, a Bbb7b5#9.  There are a few different ways of thinking about this chord; it's also an Eb13/A (or Eb13/Bbb).  You can analyze it how you want; when I wrote it, I wasn't actually thinking in those terms.</p>
<p class="text">We had a false ending; where do we go from here?</p>

<? createExample('Hai-Kai I H'); ?>

<p class="text">This next section begins with the same material as the intro, except with the tuba doing a different thing underneath.  Kind of a generic transition, really, but at 120, we hit basically the same thing as measure 16, way back after letter A.  From there on out, with the small difference that 121 is a dynamic level louder than 17, the music is exactly the same.  The sameness continues:</p>

<? createExample('Hai-Kai I I'); ?>

<p class="text">And continues:</p>

<? createExample('Hai-Kai I J'); ?>

<h4 class="question">Why so much repetition?  What's the point?</h4>
<p class="text">Repetition is how you solidify the music with the listener, as I've said before.  Too much repetition can be bothersome, of course, because then the listener is saying "hey, I've already heard this; let's move on".  Here it's not a huge deal.  There's a section of about 46 measures that gets repeated, and that's it.  The repetition also acts as a recapitulation, but I've been trying to keep "repeat" and "recap" distinct because the recap is usually <em>not</em> a simple repeat.  The repeat, though, is a nice way to lull the listener into a sense of security, making any changes more prominent.  It also codifies the repeated sections as somehow important.  In this piece, I do a staggered repetition, where the repeated bits are a little interspersed with new material.  This also helps to keep it fresh; some stuff repeats, but it's in a different context.  So far, we repeated (most of) the intro at E (in a different rhythm, with interjections, etc.), had new stuff at F and G, and then repeated the part after the intro all the way at H.  We'll see in a bit how the repetition continues, but the first clue is at 167, which is different from 63 in that the scales are ending up higher.  Higher where?</p>

<? createExample('Hai-Kai I K'); ?>

<p class="text">Here we have the repetition of the sun theme, but while at letter D it was in Db, here it's a step higher in Eb (it's otherwise identical for those first six bars).  Consequently, it feels brighter than the earlier one — maybe it's later in the morning now or something?  I didn't think of a metaphor like that when I was composing the piece.  Whatever.  This second sun theme is the piece's last climax, so we know we're close to the ending, right?  All that remains now is to get to that ending.  When I was composing this, I realized that the shout from earlier is the best way to end, so I composed measures 174 through 178 to get us there.  Throughout the recap, we've been adding the sky motif, the bossa nova rhythms, in the accompaniment, so that's what happens here.  174 is filler; 175 is filler (but with more accompaniment); 176 is rhythm; 177 is filler; 178 is the setup for the transition.  By the way, I just want to stress that "filler" here isn't used in a derogatory way.  The style of the piece in general is to have some big chords, some noodling, more big chords, more noodling, etc.  The noodling is filler in the sense that it exists to fill the time between big chord hits.  It's still interesting, but it's not melody, for example.</p>
<p class="text">From 179, we're now consciously building towards the final shout.  Building up is easy: start soft and get loud.  The transition here is loaded with motivic elements as well, because why not.  The scalar and chromatic lines at 181 are also an easy effect for any buildup, since it builds anticipation for the arrival:</p>

<? createExample('Hai-Kai I L'); ?>

<p class="text">This final shout is the same as before, at letter G, except for the very end.  I think letter G worked really well, which is why I decided to just copy the section exactly here at L.  The only thing missing is the true ending; letter G has a false ending that transitions into something new, but here, we want to end decisively.  We'd already established at G that there's a measure of filler after the cadence at the downbeat of 194, so here, this measure of filler transitions into more appropriate final chords, which are just IV - V - I in Db, built on the blueberry/aqua motifs.  The melody here is 1 - 3 - 2; it may seem weird to end a piece on the 2 instead of the 1, but in jazz and bossa nova it's typical to end with a bit of dissonance, and I used that convention here.</p>
<p class="text">The shout itself is high energy, which means that when the piece ends, we're energized.  The ending doesn't take too long.  You know it's coming, but there's no big delay or anything like that.  Instead, the high-energy shout continues into a short final cadence in a similar style, using motifs from earlier.  It ties things up nicely, I think.  As I mentioned earlier, there are many different ways to go about making an ending; I chose this way because pretty much everything that was going to happen in the piece has already happened.  We've essentially gone through the piece twice, though we started the second time through before we were done with the first.  When we repeat the shout, that's basically it; we're out of music.  Anything else would just be artificially lengthening the piece.  So I simply put a nice little <em>button</em> — which just means an actual ending — at the end of the repetition and called it done.</p>
<p class="text">After this ending comes the second movement, then the third.  I'm not going to analyze those here, but you should listen to them now that we've analyzed the first movement and see how the motifs get transformed into new contexts.</p>
<p class="text">As a whole, this piece is not perfect.  There are quite a few issues with it, many of which I pointed out.  But I think it's a decent illustration of my own personal compositional process; if you want to write music yourself, you need to figure out yours, maybe using this one as a model.  To summarize, I did some planning before I started — but not very much — then I just started writing some stuff, and I abstracted what I wrote into motifs that I then reused ad infinitum while trying to give the overall piece a coherent shape.  A lot of the hard parts — the chord voicings, for example — were done more by trial and error than active planning.  A lot of where to go next was basically composed by ear; I'd listen to what came before and tried to continue the music in my mind until I found something I liked.  To end, I basically went through the form that I chose, which was basically an exposition and a recap, with the recap kind of interspersed with the exposition; when the form was done, I didn't let the piece overstay its welcome and wrapped it up with a button.</p>
<p class="text">I think that <em>you</em> can do what I did, or something similar.  <em>You</em> can vaguely plan a piece, start writing it, elaborate on the motifs, and eventually reach an ending.  If you listen to some of my other music, you can hear that sometimes I'm more successful and sometimes less; sometimes the music drags too long with different contrasting sections, and sometimes it ends too soon.  I hope that this goes to show that you can write music that isn't perfect, and that's OK.  You won't get better unless you make some pieces yourself.  Not everyone who wants to learn music theory also wants to compose, but if you do, my advice is that you should just go and do it.  If it turns out less than good... rewrite it.  Or compose a new piece that's better.  You can do it!</p>
<h4 class="question">Any more advice?</h4>
<p class="text">Sure.  I've seen plenty of... bad attempts at composition.  I've been asked to look over music people have written, and I've seen plenty of stuff that just doesn't sound very good.  So far we haven't covered voice leading rules — right, they're not rules, just guidelines — but I've seen people write otherwise passable music that has a few bits that could be improved with better part writing.  I've also seen people write textures that are just un-fixable, or just very badly executed.  I've seen people try to create music and end up with random shit that is <em>not</em> what they intended to create.  I recommend that you try to avoid all this.  The voice leading, eh, we'll get to it.  It's actually not that simple.  It's the other stuff that concerns me here.</p>
<p class="text">The <em>best</em> thing you can do is acquire a repertoire and shamelessly copy it.  I played in wind orchestras for many years, for example, so I know the textures and styles used in wind orchestra music.  I've sung a cappella for a while too, and while too much of what I've sung has been my own arrangements, I've picked up some general tricks as well.  I've listened to quite a bit of music as well.  This means that when I need to do anything, I usually have some model for how it's been done by other people, and I can adapt it for my needs.  For example, back in <? exampleLink('Stars and Stripes'); ?> we looked at Stars and Stripes Forever, which has a smooth melody in the clarinets and a rhythm pattern in the tubas, trombones, horns, etc.  Now I know that effect.  When I want a motor for a march, I can appropriate Sousa's oom-pah style or create a similar one of my own.  But I've heard and played <em>many</em> pieces with some sort of oom-pah pattern, so if Sousa's isn't the kind of thing I want, I can choose from everything I know.</p>
<p class="text">The same principle applies to creating melodies or textures or you name it.  We've spent quite a while in this book analyzing melodies; the hope is that when you want to write your own, you'll consider how those other melodies are structured and get ideas.  I once saw a piece (no names given; I'm sorry if you think it was yours) that consisted of... kind of random diatonic chords with a kind of random quarter note melody that mostly hit chord tones.  It's been a while; I don't remember it well.  It was written by someone who was a music beginner in some ways.  If this person had paid closer attention to his/her repertoire, the person would have known that a melody generally ought to have more varied rhythms, more directional chord progressions, etc., but the person was a beginner and didn't know those things.  When you write some music, you should decide first whether you like it.  It's your music; you need to approve of it or it's not done yet.  If you don't like it and you don't know why, you should listen to some music that you <em>do</em> like and try to figure out what that music has that your piece doesn't.  The more analysis you do, the better you'll be at catching these things.  For example, hopefully we've done enough motivic analysis that you can identify motifs in the music you hear.  Does your music use motifs in a similar way?  Should it?  What about direction; is your piece going somewhere?  Does what happens next logically follow from what has happened so far?  Does the music flow?  Whenever you're writing, if you ever answer one of these questions in a way you don't like, you should probably rewrite the offending bits.  What you hear in the first movement of Hai-Kai is the result of many attempts to write music that flows logically; most of the attempts failed, so I deleted them.  You only see the successful ones.</p>
<p class="text">When you're writing music, don't be afraid to make mistakes.  Just delete them until you find something that works the way you want it to work.  The important thing is to keep trying.</p>
<p class="text">Next we'll talk about a few more aspects of composition before finishing the chapter.</p>

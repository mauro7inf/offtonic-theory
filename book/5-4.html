<p class="text">Now that you can sing and identify the intervals and hopefully understand a little about how they behave and how they sound, I think we're actually ready to move on.</p>
<h4 class="question">Whew!  That was long!  What should I know from this chapter?  I dread to ask.</h4>
<p class="text">EVERYTHING.  Well.  Hopefully you know a little bit about sound and how frequencies and pitch relate, because that's really helpful to understand what it means to be in tune.  And you should know, by listening, whether things are in tune.  You should be able to tell if a fifth is right, if a third is right.  And you should definitely be able to tell your fifths from your thirds!  You should be able to identify any scale degree or interval by listening.  And you should hopefully understand how to use the different intervals in your own writing, though I suspect that facility will come later.</p>
<h4 class="question">What about all the fractions?  The 3/2 fifths, 5/4 major thirds, septimal and undecimal intervals, Pythagorean intervals, 17-TET and 19-TET intervals, all that stuff?</h4>
<p class="text">Don't worry about those for now.  The important bit there is that you should know what 12-TET is relative to all those other things that are not 12-TET, and you should be aware of how 12-TET isn't actually in tune.  We'll talk about the specifics more in later chapters, but it's kind of an advanced subject and it's only relevant if you care about that sort of thing.  I think it's incredibly cool, personally (and I have a bit of personal history with microtonal music that I don't need to get into), but most Western music sticks strictly to 12-TET, and that's OK, so long as we understand that it's out of tune.  You should know that a 5/4 major third exists and it's not 400 cents, but more than that, don't worry about it for now unless you're interested.</p>
<p class="text">There's one more thing I'd like you to know from this chapter, and it's a bit unrelated but not really.</p>
<h4 class="question">What is it?</h4>
<p class="text">How to do melodic analysis.  Very soon we'll start doing harmonic analysis, and it can feel all-consuming.  When self-taught people start learning music theory these days, they actually <em>start</em> with chords.  They skip almost all of the stuff we've done in these first six chapters (I'm including chapter 0, because that seems to be the most missed chapter of all).  As a result, they don't know anything about melody.  It should be really obvious to you by now that the melody is the most important part of a piece of music (well, for music that has a melody, anyway).  If you frequent various music theory forums online, though, the questions are pretty much all about harmonic analysis, and whenever there's a question about melody, it can feel as if the person has never listened to a piece of music in his or her life.  Stuff like "for two instruments to be able to play together, they just need to be in the same key, right?"</p>
<h4 class="question">What?  WTF?  Seriously?  That makes <em>no</em> sense.</h4>
<p class="text">I KNOW!  I mean, no offense, but how can someone who knows even a little bit of music theory be so off-base?  And it gets worse.  My friend is a high school teacher, and one of his students once brought a ukulele to class.  My friend asked that student to play a D (or something like that), and the student only knew how to play a D <em>chord</em>, not a D <em>note</em>.  The student did not understand the notes that went in the chords, just the chord shapes.</p>
<h4 class="question">There are people like that?</h4>
<p class="text">There are.  There really are.  This is one of the reasons why I'm writing this book: if those people can read it, they will be able to learn.  You, who started with notes and rhythms, with notation, with scale degrees, and now finally with intervals, you <em>have</em> that basic understanding of music.  Because you've seen the examples I've shown with all the accidentals, you know that you aren't restricted to the seven notes of the scale.  And now, when we finally work on chords, you'll understand what chords really are.</p>
<h4 class="question">And what are they?</h4>
<p class="text">I suppose we'll see in the next chapter, won't we?</p>

<p class="text">The answer is that you get to pick.  Generally the eighth note stays constant:</p>
<? createExample('metric modulation constant 8ths'); ?>
<p class="text">But you could make the beat stay constant instead:</p>
<? createExample('metric modulation constant beats'); ?>
<p class="text">This is denoted with that little expression, quarter note equals dotted quarter note.  What this means is that the old thing on the left is the new thing on the right.  So, in this case, the old quarter note is the new dotted quarter note; in the previous example, the old eighth note is the new eighth note.  This is known as a <em>metric modulation</em>.  In <? exampleLink('metric modulation constant 8ths'); ?>, we start at quarter = 96 and end at dotted quarter = 64.  While the eighth note stays constant, the beat changes.  In <? exampleLink('metric modulation constant beats'); ?>, we start at quarter = 96 and end at dotted quarter = 96.  The beat stays constant but the subdivision changes.  This is also sometimes notated as <em>L'istesso Tempo</em>.</p>
<h4 class="question">Can you do other sorts of metric modulations?</h4>
<p class="text">Sure, why not?  A metric modulation is a change of meter.  Unlike earlier, where we were talking about pieces whose meter changes every measure or just briefly, generally a metric modulation is more permanent; we were in one meter for a while and now we'll spend another while at another meter.  (Of course, you don't <em>have</em> to use metric modulations this way.)  For example, you could go from 4/4 into cut time (2/2) with quarter note = half note, which keeps the tempo the same, or quarter note = quarter note, which halves the <em>feel</em> of the tempo while keeping the motion the same.  Here's an example:</p>
<? createExample('metric modulation half time'); ?>
<h4 class="question">What are <em>those</em>?  Metronome part, third measure.</h4>
<p class="text">Oh!  Half notes!  That's just what X-notehead half notes look like sometimes.  Whole notes look the same, but without the stem.  Some people actually use diamond-shaped noteheads for half notes instead of these, but this is Sibelius's default.</p>
<p class="text">There's other fun stuff you can do with metric modulation, too.  In one of my a cappella arrangements (same one I mentioned earlier about the "now, quickly"), I did a cool thing (well, I think it's cool): I had a section in 4/4, and when it ended, there was a kind of constant beat.  I did an accelerando — tempo getting faster and faster gradually — until it was twice the original tempo, and then I did a metric modulation, half note = quarter note, back to the original tempo, but now that constant beat was going twice as fast for the next section.  I don't have a recording but it's a cool effect.</p>
<p class="text">Generally, a metric modulation happens whenever you change tempo/meter while keeping <em>something</em> constant.  In <? exampleLink('metric modulation constant 8ths'); ?> and <? exampleLink('metric modulation half time'); ?> we kept the note lengths constant (eighth = eighth or quarter = quarter) but changed the feel; in <? exampleLink('metric modulation constant beats'); ?> we kept the beat constant (quarter = dotted quarter).  In any metric modulation, you'll have some note value in the section before the metric modulation equal to some note value in the section after.  You could have quarter note = dotted half note, or eighth note triplet = eighth, or really anything.  Get creative!</p>

<p class="text">Anyway, we finally get to move on from rhythms to other completely different things!</p>
<h4 class="question">Hooray!  So what should I know in this chapter?</h4>
<p class="text">You should understand how different time signatures work and how they help define the meter of the music.  You should know the basic time signatures as well as some of the more irregular ones.  You should be cool with the concept that meter can change.  You should know how to deal with tuplets.  And, finally, you should know how to write music that's actually legible.  You have no idea how often I have to edit someone's completely illegible rhythms.  Like, people just don't get the concept.  But now hopefully <em>you</em> do!</p>
<p class="text">Next chapter we'll get to some of the fun notation stuff, and with that, you should be all set to understand music notation anywhere you see it â€” and you'll see a lot of it when we start actually doing music theory!</p>

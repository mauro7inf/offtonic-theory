<p class="text">You should now know how to read music!  Almost anything, excluding some very instrument-specific notation, should be understandable to you now.  I would recommend going through some real music on IMSLP or elsewhere and singing through it, like in previous chapters.  If you like videogame music, read sheet music for that.  Another <em>incredibly</em> helpful thing you can do right now is find music you like and <em>transcribe</em> it.  Transcription means taking what you hear and writing it in music notation.  It's not an easy thing to do, but it's the first step to analysis, and if you want to understand why a piece of music sounds good, this should be your first step.  Write down the melody at least (we haven't done chords yet, so don't worry about those for right now unless you already know them), and see if you can learn anything interesting about it.  What notes does it use?  Why do you think it uses those notes and not, say, other notes?  What patterns can you see?</p>
<p class="text">In the next part of the book we're going to start learning music theory for real, and it's very important to have a well-trained ear in order to understand it and apply it.  That's why I've been asking you to sing, as I mentioned.  Transcription is the flip side of that coin.  Singing means taking a written piece of music and using your ears to make sound; transcription is taking a heard piece of music and using your ears to write it down.  There are free tools, like <a href="http://www.audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a> and the speed controls on YouTube, that can slow music down so that you can hear it better, or <em>transpose</em> it, which means to take every note and move it up or down by the same amount.  Your transcriptions will help you build your musical toolbox.  I would guess that you have very little interest in the majority of the music I've shown you so far: classical stuff, Brazilian and Jewish folk stuff, and if you're lucky some videogame music.  Where's the EDM?  The modern pop stuff?  Yeah, well, I don't know much about those genres.  So what can <em>you</em> do?  Listen to music in those genres and transcribe it.  Use your ears to listen carefully to as much as you can so that you can learn as much as you can.  Find sheet music and sing through or play the different parts.  Beat box the percussion (it doesn't have to be good); sing the top line or the bottom line in the guitar; sing the bass.  The more of this you do, the easier music theory will be.</p>
<h4 class="question">Sounds good.</h4>
<p class="text">All right.  Onwards to music theory, then!</p>
<h4 class="question">Onwards!</h4>

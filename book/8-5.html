<p class="text">I've had the misfortune of hearing some <em>bad</em> music.  What is it missing?  Something that can't be taught: TASTE!</p>
<p class="text">...Or <em>can</em> it?</p>
<h4 class="question">Probably not!</h4>
<p class="text">I like your optimism.  Go fuck yourself.</p>
<h4 class="question">Now, see, <em>that</em> was in poor taste.</h4>
<p class="text">...Or <em>was</em> it?</p>
<h4 class="question">It was.</h4>
<p class="text">Fair enough.  Still, I'm going to try, because, again, I don't want to have to deal with bad music.  That's why I'm writing this book, to try to lower the noise of people asking obviously stupid questions when it comes to music theory, and tasteless compositions are part of that.</p>
<p class="text">Let's start with an example.  This is Hamelech, "The King", from the beginning of the High Holiday morning service proper (after the preliminary stuff).  One of the main themes of the High Holidays is that God is celebrated as the king, so on these days, the morning service begins with "<strong>THE KING</strong> sits on a lofty and exalted throne."</p>
<h4 class="question">Bold-faced and in all caps?</h4>
<p class="text">Effectively, yeah.  The prayerbook generally has "Hamelech" written in a much larger font, justified to the center, with the rest of the text in more normal type.  Clearly it's meant to be very emphatic.  Aryeh Bernstein recorded it for <a href="https://www.hadar.org/tefillah-music/archive/yom-kippur">Mechon Hadar</a>; the download link is under Yom Kippur Shaharit and says "Download YK Shaharit 01"; the passage in question comes at about 5:03.  Here are the notes he sings (approximately, and transposed up), followed by two recordings of me singing it:</p>

<? createExample('Hamelech'); ?>

<h4 class="question">The first one's boring; the second is fancy.  Neither is exactly what's written, though.</h4>
<p class="text">Right.  We have to analyze this melody a bit differently from other melodies, because this melody is just one example of how a cantor might chant this line.  There's a kind of wordless melody at the beginning, followed by "Hamelech" at a higher pitch, "yoshev" back down, a little wordless interlude, the 4/4 walking theme at measures 7 and 8 (sung by the congregation along with the cantor), and an ending bit on "al kise ram v'nisa".  These features are generally held in common between versions of this chant, but the specifics are all over the place.  Thinking in A minor, "Hamelech" goes 1 5 b3 1, but some people do just 1 5 1 or 1 b3 1 or even in major, 1 3 1.  1 5 b3 1 does have the benefit of being a recognizable motif from elsewhere in the service.  The opening section is in E Ahavah Rabbah (phrygian dominant), but that's not actually that common.  A minor is just as likely (assuming the rest of the keys line up, obviously; a cantor can do this in any key).  The little melody between the "yoshev" and the 4/4 walking motif at measure 7 is improvised, but this motif is common.  Not everyone does the walking motif (which comes up at other parts of the service as well as other parts of the liturgical year).  The ending motif is also a common one throughout the service, but the version Aryeh sang is a bit simplified; I used the full motif in the second recording.  Plenty of people don't use that ending motif at all, though, keeping in mind that this is just the first line of a rather long service (an hour to an hour and a half until the next service).  Hamelech is improvised, but within a framework; even when it's totally different, it still sounds pretty similar.</p>
<p class="text">Now, let's understand what I did.  I mostly stuck to Aryeh Bernstein's notes (so that you could follow along), but in the first recording, I did it as flatly as I could, and in the second, as expressively as I could.  In the first recording, I treated the notes as points to hit in order.  The melody at the start was basically done note-for-note, without particular regard for rhythms.  "Hamelech" was just notes.  The "yoshev" and the little bit after were kind of jumbled.  The walking theme... well, that one doesn't matter because the congregation sings along, but it was rushed.  The ending was just boring and emotionless.  On the other hand, in the second recording, I did the opposite.  A quick analysis will show that the climax of this lime is the very beginning, "Hamelech".  As I mentioned, it's usually in large print, centered on the page, so you know it's the most important thing.  So I slowed down and did a crescendo into "Hamelech", and I emphasized every note.  This word is meant to be kind of like a bugle announcing a king!  It's a big deal!  The rest of the line is still dramatic but not excessively, and it's embellished as befits the setting.  There are a few little flourishes here and there, because this is the introduction to the High Holiday morning service.  It's <em>not</em> routine.  Later on in the service, there are walls of text to get through, and at that point, the cantor should pretty much just speed through it, especially the parts of the walls of text that are also in the daily and Shabbat services.  It's not interesting; it's not special.  But the <em>first</em> line of the service <em>is</em> special!  At measure 9 I don't go to the B.  Why?  Because it's low and doesn't sound so great when I sing it.  I get more power on the E.  In the first recording, I don't care about power, but in the second, I do.  I also use a fancier ending at 10 than the written one, mostly because I've heard it in other recordings and I prefer it that way; I feel that my way is a better ending.</p>
<p class="text">Why did I do all that?  Because I have good taste, that's why!  Also, because I recently heard something similar to the first recording and it pissed me off.  How do you not realize the need for dramatic flair?  I understand just being bashful and not wanting to sing with emotion, but these people <em>signed up for leading a major service on a major holiday</em>, so presumably they should be OK with it, no?  The sad answer is that the people who sing like the first recording are lacking in experience and taste.  Popular music doesn't have this kind of drama, so if you're used to that only, it may just not make sense for you to inject drama into music.  Or maybe they just don't know to look for it.  They try to remember the notes as well as they can from a recording, but there are a bunch of them so whatever.  There's religious meaning in the words, but as long as you say them properly, it doesn't really matter.  Maybe they even went to a lesson once where they were taught how to properly break up the phrase (which happens to be relevant for the very next line after Hamelech) so they know how to do that.  But they don't put meaning and feeling and <em>affect</em> into the <em>music</em>.</p>
<h4 class="question">So how can I avoid having bad taste?</h4>
<p class="text">I am so very glad you asked!  Only issue is... I don't know the answer.  Whoops.  But I'm going to try anyway.</p>
<p class="text">The first thing you need is a sense for musical drama.  The things you control are dynamics and phrasing, first, and tempo if possible.  Phrasing refers to making phrases feel connected and giving them shape, generally through articulation and dynamics.  Using these aspects of music, you can give it the appropriate shape and feeling.  Benjamin Zander has a <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/benjamin_zander_on_music_and_passion?language=en">very good TED talk</a> on this, which he called "one-buttock playing".  The relevant bit is the first four minutes or so.  The rest of the talk is interesting too, especially around 6:40 when he plays Chopin instead of Mozart.  He does some nice analysis and talks about music theory, but the one-buttock playing is what's most important.  He plays through Chopin's Prelude Nº4 in Em starting at about 13 minutes, and as a pianist, he has the luxury of varying his tempos as he wishes.  Pay close attention to where he slows down.  Notice anything?</p>
<h4 class="question">He slows down on the higher notes, right?</h4>
<p class="text">It's a bit more than that.  The higher notes aren't just higher.  They're dissonant, and they're unstable.  The piece begins with B - C - B, and as Zander says, the role of the C is to make the B sad.  We can get a little more erudite about it, can't we?  The chord is an E minor chord, and the C clashes sharply with that chord, making it dissonant.  The C also has a strong melodic tendency to resolve down to the B, making it unstable.  Both of these features cause the C to be a source of <em>tension</em>, and when it arrives at B it's a satisfying <em>resolution</em>.  Not <em>very</em> satisfying, of course, since the piece just started and too much resolution ends the piece, but there's a tension and a resolution nonetheless.  Tension and resolution drive the music — they drive most music, at least; some of it may be based on other factors, like the minimalist stuff we saw earlier in the chapter.  And, life lesson, the resolution is <em>way</em> better when you <em>really</em> want it.  Play up the tension.  Make the listener wait just a little longer, if possible.  This requires <em>identifying</em> the spots of tension and resolution, so some analysis is necessary.</p>
<p class="text">There are many kinds of tension.  The most obvious one in Western music is harmonic tension, and if you're the kind of music theory beginner that starts with Roman numerals for chords instead of melody, this might be the only one you know.  Harmonic tension is when a chord wants to lead to another chord, like a V7 wanting to go to I.  What drives this tension?  The tritone in the V7, obviously.  Except that V - I still works and the V doesn't have a tritone.  Whoops.  But generally, whenever one chord needs to resolve, that's harmonic tension.</p>
<p class="text">Melodic tension is the same but for individual notes: one note wants to resolve to another note, like a leading tone wanting to resolve to its tonic.  At its core, harmonic tension is just multiple instances of melodic tension at the same time.</p>
<p class="text">Rhythmic tension is the kind you don't think of as much, but it's also really important.  You feel rhythmic tension when things aren't done yet or are unbalanced.  For example, if you play eighth 16th 16th four times — one, and a two, and a three, and a four, and a — you'll be missing that last downbeat.  That's rhythmic tension.</p>
<p class="text">There are other kinds of tension as well.  You can have tension in the lyrics, which happens between a setup and a delivery.  If you set up a rhyme such that the listener knows that the rhyme is coming, you're building tension until the release, which is when you deliver on that rhyme.  A big crescendo is usually done to highlight tension in other elements, but just the crescendo by itself is tension.  That's why I love suspended cymbals.  You start rolling on the cymbal with soft mallets at <em><strong>n</strong></em> (remember, that's niente, no sound), and you gradually get louder and louder.  Everyone knows you're gonna release, so the tension keeps building!  And then hopefully you do a big release at <em><strong>fff</strong></em> instead of just choking the sound and pissing everyone off.  Hell, you don't even need a cymbal.  Do it just by saying "shh" and doing the same thing.  Another kind of tension is when you have a melodic question that needs an answer.  Back in Stars and Stripes Forever (<? exampleLink('Stars and Stripes'); ?>), look at measure 16.  This is the halfway point of the melody, and it's clearly not done yet, since it ends on the 2 of the scale on the V chord (what's known as a <em>half cadence</em>).  I'm sure you can find other kinds of tension, too.  You can create tension in any of the musical layers of <? sectionLinkShort('composition layers'); ?>.</p>
<p class="text">Good musical taste requires understanding the tension and dealing with it appropriately, which is easier said than done if you don't have experience.  One rule of thumb is to crescendo (and possibly slow down) into things that cause tension and diminuendo (and return to tempo) during resolutions.  This way you highlight the tension, which is there because the composer wanted it there.</p>
<h4 class="question">If you only slow down during tension and release, when do you ever speed up?</h4>
<p class="text">That's a good question.  You do slow down quite often during tension; it's extremely common to do a big slowdown near the end of a piece, for example, leading into the biggest resolution: the last chord!  But speeding up, when do you do that?  Turns out... not that often.  Speeding things up makes things more exciting, which is a form of tension on its own, but it goes to show that while tension and release may drive the music, they aren't the only things to pay attention to.  While a big ending on a long note is generally preceded by a rallentando, an exciting ending on a short note can be accelerated into, and if it's done well, it will leave the listener more excited rather than at rest.</p>
<h4 class="question">How do I apply this to composition?  It seems like we're talking about performance only here.</h4>
<p class="text">I'll show you an example.  Back when I was in Techiya, MIT's Jewish/Hebrew/Israeli a cappella group, I arranged a beautiful melody that I'd heard on <a href="http://www.virtualcantor.com/">Virtual Cantor</a>, Mah Ashiv.  It's a really pretty melody, so it needed a really pretty accompaniment.  Here's what I did for the first verse:</p>

<? createExample('Mah Ashiv'); ?>

<p class="text">(Please excuse the percussion notation and sound; Sibelius didn't want to do what I wanted it to do, and this is the closest I could make it.)</p>
<p class="text">Arranging is like composing, except that you already have material to work with, so it's much, much easier.  In this case, I had the melody, and the melody implies harmony... which is up to interpretation.  What I don't have are the textures I'm going to use.  That's where the imagination comes in.  For this section, I decided that the texture was going to be thin, with sopranos and altos on half note "din"s, basses doing whatever it is basses do, and tenors doing a moving rhythm to provide a pulse.  The other verses have more vocal perc, but I didn't want to introduce the drum beat this early on.  Someone with less imagination may have put everyone on the same rhythm or some sort of oom-pah oom-pah beat.  I didn't want to do that.  There's a time and place for those textures, and this isn't it.  I picked this texture because it's airy, providing resonance in the long notes in the sopranos and altos together with forward momentum in the tenors and basses.  It's very simple, with little motion to get in the way of the soloist.  Later verses get much more complex.  But despite this simplicity, there's tension and resolution, and this is where taste comes in.</p>
<p class="text">The second chord is already made of tension.  The first chord is C major, the I chord.  But the second chord has a B in the soprano.  That didn't need to be there, did it?  It's a CM7 now.  The next chord has an A in the tenor, making it Am/C, a first-inversion vi6 chord.  The fourth chord is back to C major, the I, but now the alto moved from E to G.  Why not just stay on C major the entire time?  Because it's boring!  So instead, I put in a descending line in the tenor, though it's kind of split up.  Motion!  The bass stays still; the soprano simply reflects the tenor but otherwise stays still.  The motion is subtle.  But it's not done yet.  See, the B in the second chord resolves to the A, which then resolves to the G, completing the phrase, but there's still momentum left, and the alto went to the G to signify a change.  The alto could have stayed on E the whole time, but the G provides <em>tension</em> into the next chord.  Then we just have a IV - V - I at measure 3, but that's an opportunity to play up the tension: the soprano stays on C for an extra beat, in what's called a <em>suspension</em>.  That's <em>made</em> of tension.  So much tension.  I didn't write a crescendo into that C, but during rehearsal we made damn sure that the sopranos were singing a crescendo there!  The cadence repeats in the next measure, measure 4, but here it's a much bigger deal.  We're going into the next phrase of the melody; the listener can't wait for that to happen.  So we make the listener wait.  Just like at the very beginning I slowed down at the pickup, at bar 4 I wrote a rallentando to <em>really</em> drive up the tension.  It's a crescendo, with a rallentando, with suspensions (the C in the tenor, beat 4), with dissonances (it's a V7 chord), <em>with a suspended cymbal roll</em>, all into that downbeat, where the tension releases.  The release is an a tempo at 5, and the next three bars are just like before.  The difference is bar 8, where we end the period.  A <em>period</em> is a set of two phrases, an <em>antecedent</em> (a question) and a <em>consequent</em> (an answer).  The first phrase asks the question, and it <em>must</em> be answered, hence all the tension.  The second phrase answers it, and when that ends, we're relatively at rest.  The next thing that happens is the chorus, with a different texture and everything; we don't need to build more tension into it.  At the start of measure 8, though, we've reached the tonic but we still have two beats until we're rhythmically done.  What to do?  Well, the melody itself has a nice little figure, which here I put in the soprano instead of the solo, the E - D - C thing.  And guess what?  E isn't in the G7 chord I used.  It's an <em>appoggiatura</em> (we'll talk about those later), which is similar to a suspension except the dissonant note isn't held over from the previous chord.  And we're relaxing here, not getting more excited, so instead of a crescendo into the resolution, we do a diminuendo into the resolution, again with the help of suspended cymbals.  Resolving into a soft and consonant chord is one of those things that just feels <em>nice</em> and at rest.</p>
<p class="text">That's what I did specifically, but more generally, it's usually a good idea to do something similar.  I looked for spots where I could make things more interesting and I made things more interesting in ways that are consistent with the style of the piece.  In other types of music, especially where the product isn't sheet music, zhooshing things up (that's a word, look it up) can be done in other ways.  Making chords more exciting is a big one; jazz does a lot of that.  You add extensions to the basic triad, like 7ths and 9ths.  You insert passing chords between other chords.  That sort of thing.  In pop music, the extensions might be too jazzy for the idiom, but passing chords work in most situations.  If you have to hold some chord for a while, you should generally have something interesting going on, whether it be other chords, a line cliché, a moving line, or just a rockin' accompaniment.  There's not always a lot of room for going wild in a pop song, but you don't need to go wild.  However, you do need to know when to make notes short versus long, when to syncopate versus playing on the beat, when to be more or less emotional, when to be loud and when to be soft, when to embellish and when to sing straight.  As Kohelet says, there's a time for everything under the sun (though I think he meant it in a different sense); it's up to us to do things at the appropriate time.</p>
<h4 class="question">So how can I actually compose with good taste?</h4>
<p class="text">To sum up: attention to <em>purposeful detail</em>.  If it feels or sounds awkward, it's not good.  If it's too plain, it's not good.  If it's too fancy, it's not good.  (Of course, all music has a purpose; "too plain" and "too fancy" need to be judged against that purpose.  Rule 0 and all.)  Figure out how you can make things more interesting or more meaningful.  The problem is that bad taste is hiding <em>everywhere</em>, and you need to be thorough to root it out.  My musical world these days mostly consists of a cappella arrangements, and in this world, the details that need careful thought are chords, countermelodies (melodies are usually given in the source), part writing, articulation, syllables (the timbre of the group), dynamics, perc, tempo, etc.  All of them need to be shaped beautifully like a French curve.  Way back in the <? sectionLinkShort('intro'); ?> I talked about Mr. Schwartz making music by <em>dropping</em> the stool, with a funny face, and <em>that</em> was music.  To compose with taste, you need to put the funny face on all of these elements (or whichever elements apply to your particular music) and apply them with italics, just like Mr. Schwartz did when he <em>dropped</em> the stool.</p>
<p class="text">Through experience, you learn interesting uses for chords — you learn new chords (my favorite such chords are the V11 and the V7#9) and interesting ways to use old ones (like sequences, which we'll talk about).  You learn how to shape a countermelody such that it moves forward and complements the main melody (usually you fill in the gaps, but also tastefully harmonize with the melody at points).  You learn how to write parts so that everyone is doing something interesting, because, believe it or not, the audience <em>can</em> hear the altos.  You learn how to use dits and dahs and doos, making your music hip rather than square.  You learn when to use daw and when to use doo or doom or dm or din or janana, or even more exotic syllables, to make your sound big or small.  You learn when things need to get louder and softer, when a crescendo is relevant and when to back off (fun fact: the softer everyone sings, the more they listen to each other — this fact is literally fun; try singing really softly with people and see what happens).  You learn when to cut the tempo back just a bit or when to do a big rallentando or conduct each note individually, and you learn when to allow more excitement.  I'll tell you, I've seen many scores that lack this sort of attention to purposeful detail, usually from inexperience.  On occasion I've helped people write, and they'll come up with some basic skeleton and I have to go in there and make it presentable.  There'll be chords that are just not good, because they have tendencies in the wrong direction.  There'll be rhythms that sound too square, articulations that are boring, rising tension without an accompanying crescendo, parallel fifths up the wazoo.  Many times I've had to edit on the fly to fix these errors of taste.</p>
<h4 class="question">Parallel fifths?</h4>
<p class="text">See, the traditional rules of voice leading, which we will learn in coming chapters, are a great guideline for making music that sounds good, but if you never learn them, it's much harder to follow them.  They're not rules for us because we have Rule 0, but they're worth learning anyway because they enable one to avoid making errors of taste.  Think of these rules as kind of like Strunk and White's Elements of Style for music.  I'll give you an example from a piece that was arranged for my group.  The piece has an Ab major chord, voiced (SATB) as follows, from bass to soprano: Ab Eb Ab C.  Perfectly reasonable open position chord, right?  Except that the bass has the low Ab, below the one below Middle C.  No problems here!  Alto has the Ab above Middle C, and soprano the C just above that.  Again, no problems here.  But the tenor's Eb is the low one, below Middle C.  You have a fifth between bass and tenor, an entire eleventh between the tenor and alto, and a third between the alto and soprano.  That eleventh is <em>way</em> too big, and it makes the chord sound awkward.  One of the voice leading rules for four-part writing is that the upper three parts shouldn't be separated by gaps of more than an octave, and the reason for this is that it sounds unbalanced.  <em>Can</em> you do it?  Obviously.  This arrangement did.  <em>Should</em> you do it?  Generally not.  In this case, the fix was really easy: just move the tenor up an octave!  Tenors can easily hit the Eb above Middle C.  And it doesn't even mess up the voice leading later; there was a leap up to Middle C that instead became a leap down.  I don't mean to embarrass the person who wrote the arrangement: the person was just still inexperienced, and there are many very nice moments in the piece.  But the unbalanced chord is a great example of something that a person with a developed musical taste knows to avoid.</p>
<p class="text">(Somewhere in the middle of Strunk and White's Elements of Musical Taste: "Avoid parallel fifths!  Avoid parallel fifths!  Avoid parallel fifths!")</p>
<p class="text">Whenever someone arranges something in a group in which I'm music director, it's my responsibility to look over it and offer constructive criticism.  Sometimes it can be quite extensive, and most of it has to do with fixing these small issues.  Sometimes there's something to fix in nearly every measure; other times, it's only a couple of weird chords here and there.  And sometimes the arranger is experienced and everything is great the first time, but eh.  You should do two things: you should be able to go through a piece of music with undeveloped taste and pick out what's bad about it, and you should be able to write music that doesn't have those problems in the first place.  By knowing the rules and by paying attention to the purposeful details — keep that phrase in mind, <em>purposeful details</em> — you can make music that sounds the way you want it to sound <em>and</em> sounds great.  Both of those.</p>

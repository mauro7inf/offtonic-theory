This repo contains two aspects: code and text.
  The text is Â© 2017 Mauro Cutz Braunstein.  Don't repost it (or sell it) without my permission.
  The code is free for non-commercial use with attribution, meaning that you shouldn't sell my code under your name.
  On the other hand, you're welcome to take ideas from my code for whatever you want.  Just don't
    copy the code and sell it or pass it off as your own.
  You can make derivative works of the code for non-commercial use with attribution.  The text is governed by standard
    copyright law.

It should be pretty simple to tell what's text and what's code.
  Anything parsed by a browser or interpreter is code;
  anything else other than code comments is text.

Example images may contain material copyrighted by their respected authors, used here under Fair Use.
  Other images, such as those used in interactive demos and including UI elements, can be considered part of the code.

Someday there will be a more detailed license, but for now, if you use the material in this repo, you agree to be bound by
  the most reasonable reading of these terms.  In cases where the wording may be a bit inexact but my intention is clear,
  you're bound by my intention.  For example, from time to time there may be portions of the text that are commented out.
  That's obviously still text, not code comments; you don't get the excuse that I didn't explicitly say it above therefore
  it's unclear.  If my intention is actually unclear, then you can contact me in good faith and ask.

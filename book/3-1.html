			<h4 class="question">n?</h4>
			<p class="text">A lot of musical terminology comes from Italian, which was the language of music around the time it was codified.  So we have the word for "soft", <em>piano</em>, and the word for "loud", <em>forte</em>.</p>
			<h4 class="question">Huh, piano?  Like the piano?</h4>
			<p class="text">The other way around, actually!  Before the piano was invented, people used the harpsichord, which would play at the same volume no matter how hard you struck it.  A new instrument was invented that could play both soft and loud, so it was called the pianoforte, meaning "softloud".  The name got shortened to just "piano" and it stuck.</p>
			<p class="text">Anyway, these terms are abbreviated <em><strong>p</strong></em> for "piano" and <em><strong>f</strong></em> for forte.  But just soft and loud aren't enough to properly encompass the gradations of dynamics in music — <em>dynamics</em> is just the fancy word for volume, and these abbreviations are known as <em>dynamic markings</em>.  So, in addition to <em><strong>p</strong></em> and <em><strong>f</strong></em> we have <em><strong>pp</strong></em>, <em>pianissimo</em>, and <em><strong>ff</strong></em>, <em>fortissimo</em>, meaning "very soft" and "very loud", respectively, and we have <em><strong>mp</strong></em>, <em>mezzopiano</em>, and <em><strong>mf</strong></em>, <em>mezzoforte</em>, meaning "medium soft" and "medium loud", respectively.  The "standard" lineup of dynamic markings, if you will, are <em><strong>pp</strong></em>, <em><strong>p</strong></em>, <em><strong>mp</strong></em>, <em><strong>mf</strong></em>, <em><strong>f</strong></em>, and <em><strong>ff</strong></em>.  Occasionally, though, composers want to push extremes, and we get <em><strong>ppp</strong></em> and <em><strong>fff</strong></em>.  Some call these <em>pianississimo</em> and <em>fortississimo</em>, respectively, but they don't actually have a real name; they're just triple-p and triple-f.  Some composers push even farther with even more p's and f's.  We're not going to do that here.</p>
			<p class="text">Much more rarely used is the <em><strong>n</strong></em>, which stands for <em>niente</em>, meaning "nothing".</p>
			<h4 class="question">Why would you use it at all?  Wouldn't that just be a rest?</h4>
			<p class="text">Kind of, yeah.  That's why it's rare.  But sometimes you want music to actually fade out to nothing, and this is a way to notate that.</p>
			<h4 class="question">What's that fp thing?</h4>
			<p class="text">On the other side of the double bar, there are three things worth mentioning.  The first is that <em><strong>fp</strong></em>, called a <em>fortepiano</em>.  It means to start the note forte but immediately get down to piano.  It's not too tricky to do on a timpani roll or a wind instrument, though you'd have trouble on a piano!  Next to it are these widening lines followed by narrowing lines.  These are called <em>hairpins</em> (because they look like hairpins, obviously), and they mean to get gradually louder or softer.  The one that gets louder is called a <em>crescendo</em>, and the one that gets softer is called a <em>diminuendo</em> (or sometimes <em>decrescendo</em>).  If the music is getting louder or softer over some time, you might see <em>cresc.</em> or <em>dim.</em> (or <em>decresc.</em>) written in the music instead of these hairpins.</p>
			<p class="text">In addition to these, there are some other dynamic markings, as well as written directions.  The dynamic marking you're likely to see outside this list is <em>s<strong>f</strong>z</em>, which stands for <em>sforzando</em>, or <em>r<strong>f</strong>z</em>, which stands for <em>rinforzando</em>.  Both refer to the same thing: playing a single note louder than the surrounding notes.</p>
			<h4 class="question">Wait, louder than surrounding notes?  Why do you need to notate that in a special way?</h4>
			<p class="text">Each of these dynamic markings remains until a new one shows up.  So if you're currently at mf, you're going to stay at mf until you see a p or a crescendo or something like that.</p>
			<p class="text">As for written instructions, you might see <em>subito</em> or <em>sub.</em>, which means "sudden".  This is useless to a computer, which will change the dynamic immediately upon seeing a new one, but it can convey to a human player that the dynamic is intended to switch suddenly for effect.  You may also see something like <em>più <strong>f</strong></em>, which just means "louder": "più" means "more" and <em><strong>f</strong></em> means "loud".  <em>più <strong>p</strong></em>, on the other hand, means "softer".  You may see something like <em>molto cresc.</em>; "molto" means "very", so this would be a big crescendo.  There are a few other words in Italian that pertain to dynamics, but they don't come up that often; you can just look them up when they do.</p>
			<h4 class="question">Don't you confuse dynamics with lyrics?</h4>
			<p class="text">No, because usually, on vocal staves, dynamics and hairpins are written <em>above</em> the staff.  In instrumental music they go below.  In piano music, when both hands have the same dynamic, they may just go in the middle.</p>
			<h4 class="question">So how soft is <em>p</em> anyway?</h4>
			<p class="text">This is an interesting question.  Dynamics are relative.  If you're singing a solo over an orchestra, your soft still needs to be heard by the back of the auditorium, and the orchestra's fortissimo still needs to not overpower you.  Generally, ff means as loud as you can make it without sacrificing your sound or screaming.  A bit of that may be tolerable if you see fffff or whatever.  Generally, you need to make your own calls about what's loud and what's soft, and by "you need to make your own calls" I mean your conductor will tell you, if you play in an ensemble.  On your own, the dynamics are what you want them to be.  And remember rule 0?  The sheet music is actually just a suggestion even in the best of times.  If you disagree with a written dynamic, you can always play something else.</p>
			<p class="text">But for crescendos and diminuendos, you should be a bit more careful.  Back in middle school, I was in an honor band, and the conductor asked us, "What does a crescendo mean?"  People's hands went up: "Get gradually loud!"  Nope.  "Start soft."  Crescendo means "start soft".  Now, it doesn't actually mean that.  It means to get gradually louder.  But... in order to have room to get louder, you need to start soft, even if it's not explicitly written in the music.  That's just part of the interpretation.  Obviously, without a subito piano, you won't want to make that change too noticeable!  It's really easy, though, to do a crescendo or diminuendo too fast and just be sitting there afterwards.  You have to really pace yourself!  One thing you can do is mark on your music what dynamic level you ought to be at at various points during the hairpin.  This is a fairly difficult skill to master, especially on a diminuendo.</p>
			<p class="text">It's easy to get excited in loud sections and go too fast, but don't forget that dynamics do not indicate tempo.  Be careful not to rush during forte sections as well as not to drag during sections marked piano.  Both of these dynamics also require good sound, so if you're singing or on a wind instrument, pp does not mean unsupported sound, and ff does not mean screaming.  I don't want to get too much into fluid dynamics, but basically, if you have too little air pressure, you won't be able to sustain a steady stream and your pitch will go all over the place; if you have too <em>much</em> air pressure, your stream will get all turbulent and your pitch will, again, go all over the place.  I don't know as much about non-wind instruments, but even for strings or guitars or percussion, or even electronic music, things can start to sound ugly at both ends of the volume spectrum.  Play your electronic music too loud and you'll get clipping -- that's when your waveforms are too big; we'll talk about this much later -- or worse, blow out your speakers!  Pluck your guitar string too loud and you'll get snapping.  Bow your violin too softly and your sound will be jumpy.  Just remember that dynamic markings are relative; sounding good should come first.</p>
			<h4 class="question">How important are dynamics?  Do I need to include them?</h4>
			<p class="text">It obviously depends on what you're putting them in, right?  If you're releasing a recording, who cares what you write down or even if you write down anything at all?  But if you're making sheet music for other people, dynamics are actually very important.  I very, very strongly recommend that you listen to this piece: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxwceLlaODM">Joaquin Rodrigo's Concierto de Aranjuez for guitar and orchestra, movement II</a>.  It's about 11 minutes long, but it's one of the most beautiful pieces ever written.  While you do that, pay attention to the dynamics, both in the guitar and in the orchestra.  And look at Narciso Yepes's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-string_classical_guitar_of_Yepes">CRAZY-ass guitar with 10 strings</a>.  Anyway, dynamics give emotional weight to the music and make it interesting and listenable.  You can be louder when you want more emotional intensity, softer in more tender moments.  You can use dynamics to separate out the parts of the music that need to stand out, like a melody, over the background.  Use a crescendo to build excitement — the crescendo is pretty much going to do that automatically; it's an easy trick!  Want people to pay attention?  Get subito piano at the very top of the crescendo.  When you do a crescendo and a diminuendo on the same note it's called a <em>swell</em>; it's a useful effect.  When you repeat something, repeat it at a different dynamic to make it different; during the long solo in the video I linked above, Yepes plays a phrase and then repeats it more softly and with a different stroke in order to make it different.  If you do a crescendo towards a rest, I've heard this called "the loudest rest you've ever heard"; that's also a neat effect.</p>
			<p class="text">Any good performer will add his or her own subtle dynamics to a piece, following the emotional contour of the music.  As a composer, you can control some of that process yourself.  For this, you should know your audience.  In my a cappella group, for example, people will probably not go too overboard with dynamics, even if they're written in, so when I arrange music for it, I'm pretty thorough with my dynamics so that <em>something</em> actually happens.  When I conduct other people's music, that may not really happen if the dynamics aren't written in, mostly because there's just no time to think about such things.  When you're performing or producing or whatever it is you do, take some time to think about dynamics.  Map them out carefully throughout the music.  If you're doing a solo, exaggerate the dynamics, like an actor wearing stage makeup to make his facial expressions visible even up in the balcony.  Dynamics are the herbs and spices of music.  Don't include them and your music will taste like nothing.</p>

<p class="text">In the previous section, we looked at the diatonic triads and seventh chords and their functions in Common Practice music (and whatever the equivalent is with phrygian dominant).  In this section, we're going to look at the ways Common Practice music uses functional harmony that is not diatonic.  After this section, you should in principle have the vocabulary to analyze the chords of any piece of music that follows the rules of Common Practice functional harmony.  We still have the push to extended tonality to make, but that will have to wait a little longer.</p>

<h3 class="subsection-title" id="modulation">9.5.1 Modulation</h3>

<p class="text">Modulation refers to changing keys to one with a different tonic (it doesn't count if you switch from D major to D minor, for example, but we still notate it the same way).  There are roughly three different lengths of modulation: the tonicization only lasts for a chord or two (or even three or four); a modulation lasts for a little while; a key change is more permanent.  We'll get to tonicizations in the next section.  With a key change, you generally actually change the key signature, while with a modulation you generally don't.  A march or minuet will often have a contrasting section in a different key, generally a fourth up; that section is entirely in the new key and the old key has been forgotten, so it's a key change.  A sonata or symphony, on the other hand, will roam through different keys while eventually returning to the home key; those are modulations.  Those are our concern for this section.</p>
<p class="text">To denote a modulation, we simply write in the new key and the Roman numerals for the chords below the ones for the old key, at least until the old key is no longer applicable.  Here's an example, from a classic (and classically easy to play) Mozart piano sonata, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vDxlnJVvW8">K. 545</a>:</p>

<? createExample('K 545'); ?>

<p class="text">Did you catch it?</p>
<h4 class="question">What?  Uh, no, I was bored.</h4>
<p class="text">Hey, if I can spend 20 minutes putting this excerpt together, you can spend 1 minute listening to it, even if it <em>is</em> Mozart.</p>
<h4 class="question">Ugh, FINE...  OK, yes, I caught it.  Caught what?</h4>
<p class="text">The modulation.  Remember, we're talking about modulation?</p>
<h4 class="question">No, not really.  It didn't really change keys.</h4>
<p class="text">Yes it did.  Look at measures 11 and 12.</p>
<h4 class="question">Oh, huh.  That.  Yeah, I guess it did happen.  Kinda subtle, though, right?</h4>
<p class="text">Right, that's the point.  When we get to measure 12, we've reached a cadence on the G major chord, which is the V in C.  A cadence on the V is known as a <em>half-cadence</em>.  But when the music picks up again at 13, it's... still in G.  This half-cadence in C could also be thought of as a full (authentic) cadence in G.  From 13 to the end of the excerpt, the music carries along in G.  There are more modulations after the excerpt, and by the end of the movement, we're actually repeating the material from 13 down a fifth, back in C, to end the piece in C.  Mozart visits several keys for a bit, but in the end, he comes home to the one that the piece started in, the real tonic.</p>
<p class="text">While we're here, let's do some analysis.  Mozart is not really sticking to a four-voice texture here, so he can be a little more free with the voice leading.  The piece is divided fairly clearly into distinct sections with distinct patterns and figurations, so let's take these sections one by one.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 1-4 should be immediately recognizable, since this is indeed a very famous piece.  The melody in the right hand is so, so boring.  I know.  It's not singable.  You go up in an arpeggio then leap down a sixth to go back to the tonic...  WHY?  It doesn't go anywhere!  But it does repeat: the theme in the first two bars happens again in the next two, with basically the same rhythm but a different contour.  Meanwhile, the left hand is playing chords, but it's one note at a time in a 1 - 5 - 3 - 5 pattern.  This is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberti_bass">Alberti bass</a>.</p>
<h4 class="question">Holy shit, I recognize the music on the Wikipedia page!</h4>
<p class="text">What, did you think I was lying?  I'm telling you, this piece is <em>famous</em>.  Mozart loves this shit.  I've even had to play it on clarinet in his clarinet concerto, because somehow he thought that all wind players secretly want to do is play keyboard accompaniment patterns.</p>
<h4 class="question">You're not a huge fan of Mozart, are you?</h4>
<p class="text">Gee, can you really tell?</p>
<p class="text">Anyway, here in this first section we have Mozart's characteristically inventive I - V - I's (OK, there's a IV in there, big whoop).  One thing to note is that you can look at the three notes in the Alberti bass pattern as a single chord and follow the voice leading.  In fact, you can even look at the E and G in the first bar as unimportant, structurally, so that the first bar has a chord that goes C E G C, then the second bar starts D F G B and ends C E G C.  We can proceed this way when analyzing chords in general.  Note also that each chord in the left hand moves the least amount possible to get to the next, which is why we get a V43 instead of, say, a V7.  V6 would have caused a doubled leading tone, with a B in the bass and soprano.  V64 is unstable, and viio6 doesn't allow for a good Alberti bass pattern without doubling the B.  V43 is the best choice of chord here.  In contrast, we don't otherwise have a leading tone at all in bar 4, so V65 is the chord for us.  The melody uses the 7th as a passing tone, so we could have analyzed it as V6 - V65, but there's no need.</p>
<p class="text">We then have the next phrase from 5 to 10, which is a continuation of the first phrase but with contrasting textures.  Instead of a melody, we just get scales going up and down.  The important notes here that matter for the chords are the downbeats, since the other notes are too fast to really be important.  The bass goes down by step, so you get a nice IV - I6 - (ii7 - viio6) - I.  This is not a sequence, harmonically, but the right hand <em>is</em> playing a sequence, since the scale repeats exactly the same except a step lower each time.  The pattern breaks at the end of the sequence at 9, where we start seeing some chromaticism!  The C# just makes this a D melodic minor scale, which emphasizes the D in the Dm chord while deemphasizing (get it, D-emphasizing) its pre-dominant character by not allowing the chord to even have the hint of a ii65.  At 10 we're just noodling around in the right hand, but in the left hand, you can consider the G and A to be decorations on the F, and the F# is a chromatic passing tone to the G at the top of the arpeggios at 11.</p>
<p class="text">Here at 11 and 12 we have our first <em>caesura</em>, a spot where the music stops.  There are some repeating chords to hammer the point, and then the chord of the cadence gets repeated a few times at 12.  There's nothing particularly noteworthy here, except that the cadential 64 usually happens on the strong beats as an appoggiatura chord, and here it happens on beats 2 and 4, the weak beats. making it seem more like a neighbor 64 than a cadential 64.  Hmmm, I wonder why!</p>
<p class="text">Next section, 13-17, is now part of the second theme of the movement (the first theme was 1-12).  The part of a sonata movement (in what's called <em>sonata form</em>) where the themes are first stated is called the <em>exposition</em>, which is followed by a free-flowing <em>development</em> that explores the possibilities of these themes and is finally capped off with a <em>recapitulation</em> of these themes.  For a sonata movement in major, the general custom is to have the first theme in the tonic key and the second theme in the dominant key, and when we get to the recapitulation (not in this excerpt), the first theme is either in the tonic or the subdominant, and the second theme is in the tonic key to end the piece.  This sonata movement follows the formula perfectly (which is how Mozart was able to write so damn many of them), so here we have the second theme in the dominant, G.</p>
<p class="text">We start at bar 13 with something a bit strange: a C#/D trill.  What's going on here?  We have no harmonic context.  The C# goes down to C, and now, remembering the G from the previous measure, we know that we have two notes of a V42 chord.  The pattern in the bass is a simple tremolo in bar 14, and we have some insipid theme in the melody that nobody cares about.  Mozart presumably knew this, which is why he has it repeat verbatim in 16 and 17, since he knows we didn't pay attention the first time.  The bass at 15 and 17 is more interesting, though.  It looks like an Alberti bass pattern, but it isn't: there's just a bass melody on the downbeats alternating with the D.  14 and 16 are obviously I6 chords, since the third is the lowest note, but 15 and 17 are a bit tougher to crack.  I think the downbeat is the most important, which is why I'm treating it as the bass of the chord, V42, but the voice leading is really from the A, so at the last eighth note I analyze it as V43.  You can decide for yourself if this is a good analysis or not.</p>
<p class="text">At 18-21 we have a complete circle of fifths sequence.  Bach doesn't do this: he stops sequences after only a couple of steps.  But Mozart does the whole damn thing.  The thing about sequences is that <em>everything</em> repeats at different pitch levels, so the entirety of measure 18 is copied into measure 19 and lowered a step, then into measure 20 and lowered a step, then into measure 21 and lowered a step, except for the pickup into 22, which is different.  We see in this sequence the viio going to iii, which doesn't usually happen outside of sequences.  In fact, you don't see iii used much at all.  Sequences are the one big exception.</p>
<p class="text">In 22-25 we now have some transitional material leading to the big cadence that closes the exposition.  The chromatic notes in the melody are just chromatic appoggiaturas, not harmonically important.  We have a repeating eighth note pattern in the bass during a crescendo, which serves to build up tension.  When we get to 24, with an Alberti bass, it feels like home, except it's not: it's a I64!  The I64 resolves to V or V7, and that happens here as the phrase pushes towards the I at the downbeat of 26.  Then we get some arpeggios to hammer home the tonic, at 27, that repeats an octave lower, and we get some final chords at 28.</p>
<p class="text">And then we repeat the whole thing.</p>
<h4 class="question">Ha ha, that's funny!</h4>
<p class="text"><a href="https://imslp.org/wiki/Piano_Sonata_No.16_in_C_major%2C_K.545_(Mozart%2C_Wolfgang_Amadeus)">Check out the sheet music</a>!  In the sonata form formula, the exposition repeats!  Actually, the development and recapitulation repeat too, as a unit, so if you play the whole thing with repeats, it goes exposition, exposition, development, recapitulation, development, recapitulation.</p>
<p class="text">Ah, fuck it, it's not that long.  Let's do the rest of the piece, because some more interesting harmonic stuff happens in the development and recap.</p>

<? createExample('K 545 2'); ?>

<p class="text">By the way, this is just the first movement.</p>
<h4 class="question">Oh fuck no.  No no no.  No.</h4>
<p class="text">Don't worry, we won't do the other two.  Seriously, I promise.  Even though the second movement is actually kinda pretty.</p>
<p class="text">Let's get right to it.  The exposition section contains a bunch of well-defined and stylistically distinct sections.  The development, in contrast... doesn't.  It's just one big thing.  It's really easy to tell when it ends, but until it gets there, it's just repeating roughly the same material, the scale.  It starts out more interestingly, though: the little figuration at the cadence at 26 and 27, which was just noodling around to hammer home the tonic, becomes the seed for the development section.</p>
<p class="text">We start out at 29 with the same material we just heard except in G minor instead of G major.  Going from G major to G minor like that is not generally considered a modulation, since the tonic doesn't change, but we notate it the same way; we call it a <em>modal shift</em>, since only the mode changes.  In Baroque and Classical music, true modal shifts are rare.  The available keys are the diatonic triads — in major, those are I, ii, iii, IV, V, and vi (viio can't be a tonal center since it's diminished).  To that you might add i, but you certainly wouldn't add v, so this is a bit unusual.  We get our explanation two bars later, though: the Gm sounds like the tonic, but it's actually the iv in D minor!</p>
<p class="text">This part is worth talking about in some detail.  If you look at 31-33, we have a iv - V - i in D minor, which is a perfectly commonplace progression.  Until the chord at 32, the A major (basically the only thing you have to go by is that the downbeat is a C# and the bass run starts on A, and it's A rather than A7 because of the G# in the run), there's no doubt about the G minor tonality, so you might think that the A major chord is a V/v or something (we'll get to secondary dominants soon), and then D minor is the v.  But... that doesn't make any sense.  v doesn't get used as a chord this way, especially with these repeated A7 - Dm cadences.  Since we understand what it means for a chord to be a iv or a v, we know that the chords from 31-33 are not i - V/v - v in G minor but iv - V - i in D minor.  The chord at 31 is still i in G minor from before, though, so we have a modulation, with the chord at 31 being our pivot chord.</p>
<p class="text">We stay in Dm for a very short while.  At 35, after firmly establishing Dm as the tonic, we have an interrupted melody, where we think it's going to resolve on the downbeat but it doesn't.  Instead, we launch into a sequence — in A minor!  The giveaway is the G# at 36.  We notice that the modulation up a fourth is pretty much exactly the same as the one four bars earlier, with the chord at 35 being the i in Dm as well as the iv in Am.  From 37 to 40, we have a complete circle of fifths again, this time in Am, with the left hand and right hand playing the same figurations but sometimes going to a new octave.</p>
<p class="text">Then at 41 the Bb gets introduced and we're suddenly in F.  I marked the second half of 40 as a pivot chord, but really, the modulation to F here is pretty much unexpected.  The same scale motif becomes the starting point for this modulation, and it's a big one, because when we get to 42 — hey, it's the theme from the very beginning!  In the key of the subdominant!  The effect is especially interesting because we've had near-constant 16th notes for quite a while, and all of a sudden, we're back to eighth notes.  It feels slow, and that's on purpose.  The melody might be stupid, but familiarity breeds satisfaction: the return to it is still fulfilling.</p>
<p class="text">The standard thing to do at recaps is to vary things up a bit.  This is what happens here.  42-49 goes exactly like the beginning except up a fourth.  The variation comes at 50, where a new section is inserted that's a variation of the previous four bars, just with the scale in the bass.  It's a bit of trickery, because the pattern is the same except a third lower, and that third lower enables a modulation back to the original home key, C major.  Notice how, at 51, the Bb becomes B natural to signify the modulation.  Doing it a third lower also makes the harmonic progression the same as back in measures 5-8, so when we get to measure 54, we're back on track, copying the exposition exactly from measures 9-12.</p>
<p class="text">Mozart's next curve ball is at 58, where, unlike at 13 where the cadence in G major was interpreted as a modulating cadence ending on I of the new key, the cadence at 56 and 57 is interpreted as a half-cadence, and the music continues in C major.  The music from here is again identical to the beginning but a fifth lower, in C rather than in G, at least until pickups to 65 where it simply jumps up an octave for variety.  We get yet another variation at 68, where a chord with more tension is used (the F# is essentially a chromatic passing tone from the F of 67 to the G of 68) and the melody is varied to match, leading to a satisfying ending at 71-73 that should probably have come sooner.</p>
<p class="text">In this movement, we saw a bunch of modulations.  We modulated to the dominant for the second theme, then to the minor dominant, the ii, and the vi during the development, and we did a recapitulation on the IV and the I.  Other than the stuff in the development, which is free-form, this is the standard modulation formula for sonata form.  We'll look at other pieces in sonata form in the book, as well as pieces that aren't in sonata form, and we'll see this general pattern come up pretty often in Common Practice music.  Pop music is a <em>completely</em> different animal here; pop music generally uses a different structure, and while modulations do happen fairly often (more often than you'd think), you'll be hard-pressed to find a pop song in sonata form.</p>
<h4 class="question">So how do we notate modulations in general?</h4>
<p class="text">The way we denote a modulation in Roman numeral notation is to just write in the new key and label the chords in the new key.  Sometimes there's a section that's in both the old key and the new key at the same time.  When this is just one chord, this chord is called a <em>pivot chord</em>.  It's difficult to say which is the pivot chord in this excerpt; I'd say that measures 11 and 12 are all simply dancing around that same pivot chord, the V in C which is the I in G.  When there's a pivot chord, there are two ways to notate that.</p>
<h4 class="question">Sigh, of course there are...</h4>
<p class="text">The first way, which is the way I do it, is to simply start a new line with the new key below the old one.  You can see this new line start at the last eighth note of bar 10 with that V65.  When the old key is no longer around, just continue the bottom line until the next system in the music, at which point it's just the top line.  My problem with this is that Sibelius doesn't keep the vertical placement of the Roman numerals very consistent, so it's easy to lose track of which line's which.  So I just rewrite the key, like I did at 13, and remove the ambiguity.</p>
<p class="text">The second way, which I learned in college, is to just do an equal sign, so I'd write something like C: V = G: I and continue on in the same line (of course, you wouldn't need to write the C because you already know you're in that key).  The issue with <em>that</em> is that it takes up a whole lot of horizontal real estate.  I'll occasionally use the equal sign notation in text, so you should know what I'm talking about.</p>
<p class="text">Sometimes there's no pivot chord.  In that case, which is called a <em>direct modulation</em>, you just write in the new key and proceed as normal.</p>
<p class="text">There are three basic kinds of modulations: a <em>pivot chord modulation</em>, where some chord in the first key also functions in the new key, a <em>common tone modulation</em>, where some note in the first key is held over into the next key, and a <em>direct modulation</em>, where there is no overlap between the keys.  For our purposes in Roman numeral notation, the common tone modulation is notated the same way as the direct modulation, since we're only keeping track of the chords and the chords don't overlap.  In addition to these three kinds, you can also have direct modulations that follow some logic, like maybe there's some melody that continues logically into another key, but there isn't a specific common tone.  Modulations are interesting and full of possibilities.</p>
<p class="text">Let's look at some examples in the abstract:</p>

<? createExample('modulations major'); ?>

<p class="text">The modulations that are generally available in early Common Practice are those to relative keys, keys with ±1 accidental, and parallel keys (which is a modal shift rather than a modulation).  Once we're out of early Common Practice, even as early as Beethoven, we start to see more adventurous modulations, but we'll get to those once we start talking about more adventurous chords.  So, with these modulations, from the major I we can do a modal shift to the minor i, or go to the ii, iii, IV, V, or vi.  We can also go to the relative phrygian dominant (which lies sadly outside of our system); this is also on the third degree.  Let's look at the example, then, and see what we have.</p>
<p class="text">In measures 1-4, we have a simple modal shift.  The first two bars, I - ii - V - I, simply establish the tonality; it's assumed that in real music the tonality has already been established, but in these examples you don't know that.  The next chord, the iio, comes without warning, and it's already in the key of the i, so we have a iio - V7b9 - i in the key of the i to establish the new tonality.  We denote this the same way we denote direct modulations: we just write in the new key when it happens, which here is at 3.</p>
<p class="text">In measures 5-7 we have a direct modulation to a distant key.  In measure 6 we have a C major, which is serving no particular function in the new key of E major, followed by an E major, which is serving no particular function in the old key of C major.  This is therefore a direct modulation.  I - V65 - I establishes the old key, then we directly jump into a I - V65 - I in the new key, with no transition.  However, we could say that this is a common tone modulation, since the E is kept constant between the last chord of the old key and the first chord of the new key.  Since the voice leading is so smooth, G going up a half step to G#, E staying, and C going a half step down to B, this direct modulation isn't particularly <em>abrupt</em>; it actually sounds rather smooth.  Modulations like these are used often in 20th century music, film music, showtunes, that sort of thing.  Indeed, the C major to E major chord relationship has a name: it's a <em>chromatic mediant</em> relationship.  This is <em>not</em> functional, so we'll talk about it later on.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 8-11 we modulate to the key of the ii.  First we establish the tonality with I - viio6 - I6, and the IV chord serves a dual purpose as the bIII chord in the new key, which then goes into a iv - viio7 - i cadence.  The IV = bIII is the pivot chord.  It's a bit tricky to find a pivot chord to modulate from I to ii, because you need a chord with a function in both keys, in this case C major and D minor.  C major has a B and D minor has a Bb, so that knocks out the iii, V, and viio chords (as well as I7).  C major also has C while D minor usually has C#, so that produces complications for the IV, vi, and I (and ii7).  The only triad we have left is ii, but the effect of the modulation is often stronger when the new tonic isn't provided immediately but arrived at through a few chords' worth of music.  Using the I is too simple and the vi in the old key is the minor v in the new key, which isn't a chord with a lot of use, so the best choice here, I think, is the IV (feel free to disagree, of course).  With the IV as our new bIII, we go into the cadence.  The moment we introduce the Bb, we know that there's some sort of change in tonality, but when we get the C#, we know we're going to D minor.  The C# is the most important new note, since it's the leading tone, but we get the benefit of a more complex and interesting modulation when we introduce the Bb first.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 12-15 we go to the iii.  Here, the I = bVI is a very common way to make that transition.  We could have easily used the vi instead, but at least in my experience I've seen the I used as a pivot more often in this modulation.  The voice leading is a little rough, but oh well!  Again, we establish the old tonality with I6 - V64 - I, which goes into bVI - V - i in the new key, but the new key isn't established enough for my tastes, so I did another V7 - i to hammer it in.  There are more subtle ways to do this modulation, perhaps via the vi = iv and introducing the F# before the D# by means of a iio chord, but hey, not every modulation has to be subtle!</p>
<p class="text">Measures 16-19 modulate to the subdominant.  This one's a bit hard to pull off convincingly, because the I chord is already the V chord in the new key, and this doesn't leave a lot of room to approach the new I more tastefully.  But this I = V - V7 - I modulation is extremely common in marches and other pieces where there's a trio section in the subdominant, even if it's the complete opposite of subtle.  If you wanted to be more subtle, you could do something like vi = iii - IV, introducing the 4 of the new key that way, and then eventually proceeding to a cadence.  But, again, not every modulation has to be subtle.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 20-23 modulate to the dominant.  This can be as interesting or as boring as you'd like.  You saw how Mozart did it in <? exampleLink('K 545'); ?>, doing a half-cadence to the V and just staying there.  I went a different route.  I - iii - vi actually establishes the tonic fairly well, especially since the 1 is in the soprano.  Then the vi becomes the ii, and we do a ii - V - I.  Wait, no we don't.  ii - V - <em>IV</em> - V - I.  With 7th chords everywhere.  The V7 - IV7 is a total fakeout, a deceptive cadence, which works because of the voice leading.  This makes the arrival at the I on 23 much more satisfying, which is the point of deceptive cadences.  (Note that <em>the</em> deceptive cadence is V - vi or V - bVI; this is just <em>a</em> deceptive cadence.)  This modulation shows that 7th chords can definitely be used in modulation just like triads; triads are just usually a bit simpler to understand, but 7th chords allow for more possibilities.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 24-27 are another somewhat tricky modulation, since it goes to the relative minor, the vi.  THe tricky part is making it distinctive.  Luckily, the minor has a raised 7th, so when we hear that G#, we know we're in A minor.  Since I'm avoiding explicit chromaticism within a key for now (oh, we'll get there quite soon), I didn't want to do the most common modulation here, which is I = bIII - V - i.  Instead, using the ii or IV as a pivot chord is a sound if conservative choice.  The only reason it wasn't the ii was because there would have been parallel fifths.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 28-31 modulate to the relative phrygian dominant (well, the relative Spanish scale, anyway).  This kind of thing happens in Spanish music, Russian music, and wherever the phrygian dominant shows up.  The tricky thing is that the new note — the <em>only</em> new note — is the third, in the I chord, so you need to emphasize the new tonic note some other way if you want to delay the tonic chord's arrival.  What I did here was a IV7 = bII7 modulation.  You'll recall that although the bII chord has dominant function in phrygian dominant, the bII7 chord is often pre-dominant, so I did bII7 - vø65 - I, with 1 - b2 - 1 in the soprano and b2 - b7 - 1 in the bass.  There's no question that the last chord is the new tonic, thanks to this.  Note also that the 7th in the bII7 doesn't resolve down, which helps show us that this is a new context for the chord; it's not just a IV7.  You <em>could</em> hear the second-to-last chord as a viiø65 in the old key, but... do you?  I tried resolving to I6 in the old key, and it's really unsatisfying, while the I in the new key feels natural.  I think part of that is the voicing, with the B above the A, inverting the 7th, but I'll let you come to your own conclusions about why this modulation works (if you even think that it does).</p>
<p class="text">Let's see modulations in minor now:</p>

<? createExample('modulations minor'); ?>

<p class="text">The modulations available in early Common Practice are the same as in major: ±1 accidental and the parallel and relative keys.  From C minor, then, which has three flats, we have Gm and Bb with two flats, Ab and Fm with four flats, the relative major Eb, and the parallel major C.  In Roman numeral notation, these are I, bIII, iv, v, bVI, and bVII.  iio is a diminished triad and therefore is not an available key (in early Common Practice).</p>
<p class="text">The switch to major in measures 1-4 is fairly simple: the music just starts being in major instead of minor.  This might be a bit unconvincing because IV and V are both still chords in minor, the IV in the situation when the 6th degree is raised, but notice that the 6 here <em>doesn't</em> go up to 7 like you'd expect in minor.  This free treatment of the 6 subtly indicates a change in mode.</p>
<p class="text">In analogy with <? exampleLink('modulations major'); ?>, measures 5-7 feature a direct modulation to a key in a chromatic mediant relationship, though this time the passing tone in the bass makes it a bit smoother.  When going from Cm to Abm, we again have the same thing we had before, where the root goes down a half step and the fifth goes up a half step, but instead of C to B and G to G#, we have C to Cb and G to Ab.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 8-10 we modulate to the relative major.  The key of the relative major has the same notes as the original minor key, but while the original key raises the 6th and 7th degrees, the relative major does not.  You can use that to your advantage.  In this case, the Ab in measure 9 goes up to Bb instead of down, signaling that we're using the logic of Eb major rather than C minor.  The iv6 = ii6 is where the logic changes, with that chord common to both keys.  Modulations to the bIII can be virtually imperceptible, since no new notes are introduced, so if you're in minor and you see a cadence to the bIII, odds are you've modulated somewhere and you should probably go figure out where it happened.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 11-13 modulate to the subdominant.  There's a bit better signaling in minor than in major, since the i in the old key needs to have its third raised to become the V in the new key.  This particular modulation, though, does something unusual: it uses the ii in the new minor key.  Using the v of the old key to modulate is a common technique, since the chord is in the key but doesn't get much use, but the standard supertonic chord in minor is iio, not ii.  ii happens only when there's a raised 6th, and that raised 6th goes up to the raised 7th.  This happens here, and we have a ii - V7 - i in F minor.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 14-17 modulate to the dominant.  The dominant <em>chord</em> is major, but, when modulating, the dominant <em>key</em> is minor.  It's useful to think about which notes differ between keys when modulating.  C minor is C D Eb F G Ab/A Bb/B, and G minor is G A Bb C D Eb/E F/F#, so the notes of C minor not present in G minor are Ab and B, and the notes of G minor not present in C minor are E and F#.  In this example, I chose to introduce the F# to announce the new key, but since it was on a diminished 7th chord, the introduction is a bit ambiguous, so a strong i64 - V - i cadence cements the new key.</p>
<h4 class="question">But this is an evaded cadence, right, since it ends on the i6 rather than the i?  So it's not <em>actually</em> a strong cadence.</h4>
<p class="text">That's... true, but that's not what I mean by strong.  I64 - V - V7 - i6 is very strong <em>at establishing tonality</em>; what it's not as strong at is ending a piece.  The difference in chord inversion is like the difference between closing a door and slamming the door shut.  Both will close the way into the room, but slamming the door is more forceful than simply closing it, but there's no question of <em>which</em> door has been closed or whether it was even closed at all.</p>
<h4 class="question">I see where your analogy starts to break.</h4>
<p class="text">Then keep that to yourself!  Next bit.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 18-21 modulate to the bVI in a very normal and usual fashion, with a iv = vi.  The note that signals the new key is the Db in measure 20, but see how the progression doesn't actually reach the new tonic until the very end.  In fact, for the second chord of 20, we could have used an E natural instead of an Eb and modulated to F minor instead, with a iv - viio7 - i in F minor instead of ii - V7 - I in Ab major.  It's common practice to have the modulation be ambiguous at first; it helps make the music subtle and refined.  Another common way to modulate to the bVI is i = iii - V7 - I.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 22-215 modulate to the bVII in a much less usual fashion, but it shows some of the variety possible in modulation.  The v6 happens early on, a solid choice for a pivot chord, but the modulation doesn't happen yet.  We don't take the b7 down to the b6, which is a bit unusual but not exactly <em>wrong</em>, since the skip in the bass continues by step in the opposite direction, and because of the ascending line in the bass, we use a raised 6th degree in a viø7 chord.  <em>That's</em> our pivot chord, that kind of altered chord; in the old key, we expect that raised 6th to go to the raised 7th, but instead it goes to the b7 in a IV64 - I, a <em>plagal cadence</em> (any cadence that goes from pre-dominant to tonic can be considered a plagal cadence).  In this case, the viø7 becomes the viiø7, but we don't want to get to the tonic just yet, hence the IV64 to delay the tonic a bit.  In second inversion, the IV64 is more of an appoggiatura chord anyway, but the idea is that you can establish the new tonality with something other than a V - I.  In fact, you don't <em>really</em> need to establish the new tonality strongly.  You can leave it ambiguous if you want.  You can do literally anything.</p>
<p class="text">Finally, measures 26-29 show a modulation to the relative phrygian dominant, which is the key of the V.  Again, we don't really have an established vocabulary for talking about the phrygian dominant in Roman numerals, which is why I denoted it with a lowercase g.  iv - bIII - bII - I, called the <em>Andalusian cadence</em>, is an <em>extremely</em> common harmonic pattern in phrygian dominant, so I decided to use that here with a slight modification: adding a bass 5 under the bII chord, making it a vø9 instead.  This modification makes the root motion vø - I, establishing the new tonic more strongly than bII - I or bvii - I.  A lot of phrygian dominant music is kind of in an in between state, where it could be minor with cadences on the V or it could be phrygian dominant, and this is fine, but if you want to actually make the modulation clear, a 5 - 1 in the bass helps a lot.</p>
<p class="text">So that's modulation.  To remember which keys are available, it's useful to look again at the Circle of Fifths:</p>

<canvas id="circle1" class="keyboard" height="800" width="800"></canvas>
<p class="caption"><? appletLink('circle of fifths', '(open in new tab)'); ?></p>
<div class="vspace"></div>

<p class="text">From any given key, the <em>related keys</em> for modulation are the five keys immediately next to it as well as the parallel key.  For example, from F#m, the related keys are Bm, D, A, E, and C#m, as well as F# major.  From Bb, the adjacent keys are F, Dm, Gm, Cm, and Eb, as well as Bbm.</p>
<h4 class="question">What about non-early Common Practice?</h4>
<p class="text">As music became more inventive, composers began modulating to more distant keys, or to related keys to the related keys, or just arbitrarily.  In pop music, it's pretty common to do a <em>truck gear shift</em> modulation, which is when the music directly modulates up a half step or a whole step.  And, of course, if you abandon all pretense at functional harmony, you can just go anywhere you want by means of chromatic mediant relationships or polytonality or just playing in another key out of the blue.  Modulations are a fun time to do crazy stuff with chords.  In fact, a modulation is like <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChandlersLaw">Chandler's Law</a> for composers: when in doubt, just throw in a modulation, and the music will be fresh again.</p>
<p class="text">We'll soon see an explosion of possibilities for modulation as we introduce more chromatic chords into the mix.  Until now, we've been sticking strictly to the key, and we've used modulation to stick strictly to a <em>different</em> key.  But how can we stop sticking so strictly to keys in the first place?  We'll find out in the next few sections!</p>

<h3 class="subsection-title" id="secondary-chords">9.5.2 Secondary Chords</h3>

<p class="text">Sometimes we go to a different key only very briefly, for just two or three chords.  This is too ephemeral to be a modulation; we instead call it a <em>tonicization</em>.  The chords of that secondary key are known as <em>secondary chords</em> or <em>applied chords</em>, and they are only indirectly related to the main key.  We denote them in Roman numerals with the function in the secondary key, a slash, and the chord of the main key that is being tonicized.  For example, the dominant of the dominant is V/V, read "five of five".  In C major, V is G major, and in G major, V is D major, so V/V is D major.  You can even have tertiary chords, like V/V/V, V of V of V, which in C major would be A, since A is the V of the V/V, which is D.  Some authors actually write V of V instead of V/V, so be aware of that.  For large chains around the circle of fifths, you might even see something like V of V of V of V of..., where the first V is under the B major, followed by an of, then the next V is under the E major, followed by an of, then the next V is under the A major, etc.</p>
<h4 class="question">I'm confused.</h4>
<p class="text">At this point, so am I, so let's see some examples:</p>

<? createExample('secondary functions 1'); ?>

<p class="text">Here we see a bunch of uses of the V/V.  Of course, the normal thing for the V/V to do is to resolve to V, in major or in minor (measures 1, 4, 13, 21).  We could have a V7/V instead (measures 1, 6, 13, 15, 18).  The V/V could resolve to V7 instead (measures 2, 14) or to a I64 or i64, which are suspended V chords (measures 8, 17).  Either chord could be inverted (measures 4, 8).  The V/V could even have its own secondary dominant (measure 3) or be preceded by a ii/V (measure 17).  This last one is a bit unusual, since ii/V in major is vi, which has roughly the same function already of going to ii.  If we think of V/V as a kind of ii, ii/V - V/V is not actually any different than vi - V/V.  In minor, though, there is no vi chord, so ii/V is a different sonority.  In fact, i and vi have a chromatic mediant relationship, which, again, is when two chords a third apart don't share a key.  Instead of V/V, we could also have viio/V (measure 12), which has the same dominant function in the key of the V (but this could get confused with the common tone diminished 7th chord, which we'll talk about in a little while).  The V/V also often resolves (irregularly) to IV or iv (measures 6, 15), especially in pop music.  In many of these cases, the #4, normally the leading tone to the 5 and thus having a tendency to resolve up, resolves down to 4 and then 3 instead, a process which some have called <em>sublimation</em> (because apparently this kind of motion is sublime, I don't know).  The idea is that instead of pushing forward, the #4 relaxes back down instead.  The V/V is the most common, but certainly not the only, way to harmonize a #4.</p>
<p class="text">These V/V chords are also approached in many different ways and are voiced in many different ways.  For example, the V7/V in measure 1 is missing its fifth and has its root doubled.  V/V is approached from I (measures 1, 8), V/V/V (measure 3), I7 (measure 6), IV (measure 12, though that one's actually a viio/V rather than a V/V — same difference), i (measure 13), i7 (measure 15), vi or ii/V (measure 18), and iv (measure 21), and you can use your imagination to come up with different ways of getting to the V/V.  You could even <em>start</em> the piece on a secondary chord (Beethoven begins his Symphony Nº1 on a V7/IV).  There are a wealth of possibilities.  Of note are the I7 and i7, which have a 7th degree that wants to resolve down; they can resolve to the fifth of the V/V (or the third of the viio/V, etc.).</p>
<p class="text">Using secondary chords allows us to do something we haven't been able to do yet: chromatic lines.  This stuff is absolutely king in music, whether descending or ascending.  There are many sacrifices made at the altar of the chromatic line.  Chromatic lines make things smooth and satisfying, and if you have any excuse to include a chromatic line, you should probably do it!  Measures 1 and 2 we have a chromatic line in the soprano.  Measure 3 <em>could</em> have a chromatic line in the soprano if that second E were raised to F, making a bIII+6/ii, but we still get the C - C# - D in the alto so we're good.  6 and 7 have a descending chromatic line in the alto; 11 and 12 has an ascending line in the soprano; 15 and 16 have a descending line in the soprano, etc.  In fact, secondary chords are a great (and rightly popular) way to harmonize a chromatic line.</p>
<p class="text">One caution when using secondary chords, and really all chromatic chords, is that they can cause cross relations.  A <em>cross relation</em>, also known as a <em>false relation</em>, is when one voice has one version of a note and another voice has another version of the same note in the next chord.  For example, in measures 6 to 7, the alto has an F# in the second chord of 6 while the bass has an F natural in the first chord of 7, making a cross relation.  Cross relations can sound awkward and sudden, so it's often best to avoid them in problematic cases.  Here it's not a problem because the F# actually moves down to F in the same voice; the fact that the bass <em>also</em> has an F doesn't affect the smooth F# - F in the alto.  Sometimes the cross relation is pretty much unavoidable, and that's OK.  Sometimes you actually <em>want</em> the sound of the cross relation (especially in situations where you might have both versions of the note sounding in the <em>same</em> chord, which gets nice and crunchy).  This is one of those things you should be aware of avoiding so that when you use it on purpose it has the effect you want it to have.</p>
<p class="text">One point of note here is that while the V chord is major in a minor key, the secondary chords don't necessarily act accordingly, since for modulations the related key is actually v, not V.  Don't be too surprised if you see stuff like viio7/V in minor.</p>
<p class="text">Let's see another batch:</p>

<? createExample('secondary functions 2'); ?>

<p class="text">Here we have the many faces of the V/ii.  This chord appears in major only, for the most part, because the iio in minor is not tonicized.  The V/ii is especially useful when harmonizing a #1, and it's used quite a bit in half-phrases that end on the ii chord — if you think of a complete phrase as I - ii - V - I, the first half could be some form of I - ii and the other some form of V - I, and the V/ii is inserted between the I and ii to increase the tension towards the arrival on ii.</p>
<p class="text">V/ii generally resolves, well, to ii (measures 1, 5, 9, 16, 20), but it could be a V7/ii (measures 1, 5, 9, 13) or a viio7/ii (measures 16, 20) or V/ii or viio/ii or what have you.  It could be in inversion (measures 1, 16), and instead of a plain ii, it can go to ii7 (measure 6) or ii6 (measure 16) or any other form of the ii chord.  The V/ii is a kind of vi chord, so it fits into most places such a chord could fit: after a iii7 (measure 5) or before a V7 (measure 13), for example.  Something I really like to do in my own music is what happens at measure 9, iv6/ii - V7/ii - ii.  This is nice because <em>two</em> chromatic notes get introduced, the b7 and the #1.  Adding a pre-dominant chord before dominant chords is common in jazz as well, since it adds motion to the music; V/ii is only a dominant in the sense of resolving to ii, but hey, it still counts!</p>
<p class="text">The progression in measures 19-21 is unusual because a V/ii is used in minor.  I have to be honest; this is a completely contrived example, and I'm not sure it even works that well.  The seventh of the iiø42 resolves up instead of down, and the raised 6th is doubled on the ii chord, both of which weaken the functionality of the progression.  The goal here was to get a workable dominant in before a ii chord, whose 6 necessarily progresses up to 7 and then 1.  The issue is getting to the 6 in the V/ii chord.  I decided to make it a viio7/ii instead so I wouldn't have to deal with the 6, but the b7 is also somewhat problematic because the b6 in the iiø42 chord is supposed to go down, not up.  However, there are two things that save this progression: the scalar line in the soprano and the chromatic line in the tenor.  If you have scales and chromatic lines, they hide (and justify) all sorts of bad voice leading.  Another thing that does this is a sequence; measures 5 and 6 form a circle of fifths sequence in the middle of a larger progression.</p>
<h4 class="question">What's that Ger7 in measure 17?  You kind of ignored that.  It looks chromatic.</h4>
<p class="text">I didn't want to use it, but look at the chromatic line in the soprano and scalar line in the bass!  You can hopefully see that I had no choice!  We'll talk about this chord very soon, but we've actually seen it before, back in <? sectionLinkShort('classical chords aug6'); ?>.  It's an augmented 6th chord.</p>
<h4 class="question">It's not augmented, and I don't see a sixth.  I don't even see an augmented sixth.  What are you talking about?</h4>
<p class="text">There's a sixth between the C and the Ab, dumbass.</p>
<h4 class="question">There is, OK, fine.  But what's augmented about it?</h4>
<p class="text">In normal position, the chord is spelled b6 1 b3 #4, so the augmented sixth is between the b6 and the #4.  In this case, though, it's inverted, so there's actually a diminished tenth between the #4 in the bass and the b6 in the soprano.  In any case, we'll get to it soon, so chill!</p>
<h4 class="question">I don't appreciate your tone.  I asked a question and you called me a dumbass, and now <em>you're</em> the one telling <em>me</em> to chill?  How are <em>you</em> qualified to teach anyone anything?</h4>
<p class="text">All right, all right, I'm sorry.</p>
<h4 class="question">No, seriously.  I represent the reader of this book.  When you insult me, you insult your readers.  That's not good.  I'm asking legitimate questions that your readers might be having right now, which they don't get to ask in real time because a book is a passive medium.  You seriously can't call me a dumbass when I ask questions.</h4>
<p class="text">Point taken, I'm sorry.  Look, I was just joking when I called you a dumbass.  Sometimes sarcasm doesn't convey itself in print.</p>
<h4 class="question">I'll let it slide, but man, you gotta step up your game.  If I weren't learning so much I wouldn't be here right now.</h4>
<p class="text">I'll do my best.  Let's move on, then:</p>

<? createExample('secondary functions 3'); ?>

<p class="text">There are two types of third degree, the 3 in major and the b3 in minor.  This means that the V/iii, used in major, and the V/bIII, used in minor, are different chords.</p>
<h4 class="question">Isn't that also true for the b2 in phrygian dominant?</h4>
<p class="text">It is indeed, but phrygian dominant is somewhat unstable, so chromaticism within phrygian dominant is usually pretty limited in order to bring out the mode.  The same is true for pretty much every mode that isn't major or minor.  We'll talk about that soon enough.  That said, the bII chord is used in minor (and major too, but less so), and its secondary chords like the V/bII are also available.  We'll get to that soon as well.</p>
<p class="text">The V/iii normally resolves to... iii (measures 2, 11, 16), though that iii could always be in inversion or a seventh chord (measure 16).  However, it can also go elsewhere, like iv/ii (measure 5).</p>
<h4 class="question">If it goes to iv/ii, why do you analyze it as V/iii?</h4>
<p class="text">Excellent question.  It's actually a bit ambiguous; if the chord in measure 5 were missing the A, it would be B D# G, a G+ chord, which is actually something like a bIII+ in E minor or a V+ in C major (an altered chord; we'll talk about these soon as well).  The fact that it has an A, making it a 7th chord, and with the B in the bass, makes it clear that it's a B7 chord of some sort (in this case with a b13, which you could analyze as a dominant pedal in the soprano).  The chord resolves perfectly normally to iii7, or it would if the bass at 6 were an E instead of a Bb.  The move to the Gm chord is <em>surprising</em>, because we'd <em>expect</em> an Em of some sort.  It's that expectation that drives the function, not the actual result.  You could make an argument for it being the other way around, I suppose.  By the way, this whole progression in measures 5-10 is adapted from the Super Mario World ending theme, which we saw in <? exampleLink('SMW Ending'); ?>.  Measure 7 features a viio7/V that we haven't talked about yet (V is major so it should have a viiø7, right?), but you can also analyze it as a cto7, a common-tone diminished 7th, another chord we'll talk about soon.</p>
<h4 class="question">How much more <em>is</em> there?</h4>
<p class="text">Quite a bit, just you wait!  People write whole textbooks about this stuff and never even get to where we're going, so we're explorers, baby!</p>
<p class="text">The V/iii can be problematic sometimes when approached from I, which is pretty common because you get a bVI - V - i in the key of the iii.  The problem is that the V/iii contains a #2 and a #4, and that #2 is an augmented second up from 1, so you'll want to approach it from the 3, not the 1.  The 1 in the bass goes down to the 7 because we're in root position, so the 5 can't go down to #4 or we'll get parallel fifths.  The 5 goes up to the 6 or 7 depending on whether it's a V/iii or V7/iii.  But where does the doubled voice in the I chord go?  A doubled 1 can't go down to 7 because of parallel octaves with the bass, and going up to the #2 would cause an augmented second.  It could go to the #4, but that's a tritone and it's a little weird; that said, Bach does this pretty often.  What I did in measure 11 was to just suck it up and use an augmented second.  I think it still sounds good, don't you?  In any case, it's easier to approach the V/iii from somewhere else, like a ii (measure 1) or iio/iii (measure 15), the latter of which makes a iio - V - i in the key of the iii.</p>
<p class="text">In contrast, the V/bIII doesn't have this issue.  Instead, it has the problem of b7's going down to b6's.  This is a rule that tends to get broken quickly when we introduce chromaticism, but since it's part of how the minor mode is defined, if we want the music to have the characteristic sound of minor (which maybe we don't want), we should probably try to adhere to it, right?  Of course, the V/bIII tends to resolve to bIII (measures 19, 23, 26), but it could also resolve someplace different like i.  Except if it does, it's not really a V/bIII but a bVII7, so we'll leave that for later (bVII7 - i is known as a <em>backdoor cadence</em>).</p>
<p class="text">There's one type of cross relation that's tolerated/beloved by composers, and that's the type of cross relation that happens in minor between the ascending bits of melodic minor and the descending bits.  I happen to enjoy that rough sound, and maybe you do too.  You can see it in measure 20 between the tenor Bb and bass B, and from 23 to 24 between the tenor Bb and alto B.  These cross relations happened because I chose to do a bIII - V (or bIII - viio) progression without breaking the role of the b7.  In 23, there's some more awkwardness, though, because the b7 doesn't go down to Ab; rather, another voice takes that over.  You can treat this as an example of what to watch out for instead of an example of pure perfection or however you see my examples.  From 27 to 28, the cross relation is in the 6th degrees, with the A in the tenor at 27 versus the Ab in the bass at 28.  The raised 6th is unusual in general, since it really only exists to bridge the gap between the 5 and the 7, which are more fundamental to the mode.  The 6 is just a glorified passing tone.  Because of that, cross relations involving the two 6ths are fairly rare and therefore awesome.</p>
<p class="text">OK, let's move on:</p>

<? createExample('secondary functions 4'); ?>

<p class="text">The V/IV in major is actually the same chord as the I — it does double duty.  That makes modulating to or tonicizing the IV very trivial and not particularly impressive, so we tend to use the V7/IV instead to give us a new note (measures 1, 4, 12).  Of course, we can also use other secondary chords, like the IV/IV (measures 7, 16) or the viiø7/IV (measure 8).  The V/IV resolves to IV normally, but it can also resolve to similar chords like the ii7 (measure 5) or IV7 (measure 12).  IV/IV shows up fairly often as a way to contextualize the chord built on the b7 in major, since it's not part of the scale like in minor; if you see a chord on the b7 in minor, it's probably a V/bIII, but in major, it's usually a IV/IV (or sometimes it's just a bVII; we'll get to that).</p>
<p class="text">In minor, V/iv is a bit more interesting, because it isn't just the tonic.  You can certainly still use a V7/iv (measures 19, 28, 31, 34), but a V/iv (measure 24) can still be interesting, especially in first inversion.  V7/iv usually goes to iv, of course, but it could certainly go elsewhere like a iv7 (measure 32) or iiø7 (measure 28).</p>
<p class="text">Both in major and minor, the V/IV or V/iv can be approached however I or i chords are usually approached, such as from a V7, but you can also get creative.  In major, going from I to V7/IV involves just one non-essential note changed, so it's often a good idea to move the rest of the chord as well to get some motion in there.  In minor, i to V/IV changes the mode of the chord, so it's more viable to change just the b3 to 3, but you still usually see more stuff going on.</p>
<h4 class="question">What in the holy fuck is going on in measure 35?</h4>
<p class="text">An admittedly contrived example of crazy cross relations.  Remember that minor also has a IV chord, so V/iv can resolve to IV if you have an ascending melodic line.  But what if you also have a melodic line going down at the same time?  You might end up with this crazy chord with both a major and a minor third.  In jazz, the b3 is referred to as a #9, and they have their reasons, but we can see how what's really happening is a cross relation.  And there are two of them, one on the IV and the other on the V.  I'll admit that the one on the V sounds much better, but, again, this is a contrived example.  You're welcome to go find places to use these chords yourself.</p>
<h4 class="question">Also, measure 17?</h4>
<p class="text">More augmented sixth chords!  I've been showing them to you early so that they'll make more sense when we get to them.  Actually, I've been doing that pretty much the whole book, showing you things early.  It's not just a teaser; in real life, we don't learn everything at once.  I'm giving you a full treatment of these subjects <em>eventually</em>, but by the time that happens, you've already seen the basics.  In this case, the augmented 6th chord is a chord with a b6 and a #4, where the b6 tends to resolve down and the #4 tends to resolve up.  There's another variant of that, the augmented 6th V chord, which is the same thing but it has a b2 and 7 instead of b6 and #4.  The one with the b6 and #4 resolves to a V chord, while the one with the b2 and 7 resolves to a I (or i) chord.  Again, we'll get to them in this very chapter.  It's coming up!</p>
<p class="text">I also want to point out the viio7/V in measure 20.  This is one of those situations where the V chord itself is major, but we use the secondary chords from the minor key since they're closer to the home key.  We're in C minor, so F#o7 is less foreign than F#ø7 would be.  I mean, it <em>could</em> be used, but since we're actually resolving to i64, the b3 is less out of place than the 3 would have been.  Notice that the 3 in minor is actually a chromatically altered pitch — the default is b3 — so the 3 tends to resolve up.  In general, chromatically altered pitches want to resolve in the direction of their alteration; a raised pitch wants to go up and a lowered pitch wants to go down.</p>
<p class="text">Here's the last group:</p>

<? createExample('secondary functions 5'); ?>

<p class="text">The V/vi in major is an extremely popular chord, especially in pop music.  The vi is the relative minor, so the V/vi is used to suggest that key constantly.  The V/vi's regular resolution is to vi (measure 2), but it's essentially a pop music trope for it to go to IV (measure 6); it's just <em>everywhere</em>.  It can certainly go to some kind of chord on the #4 as well, like the viio/V (measure 9), or to V/ii (measure 12).  I would actually analyze a V/vi that goes to IV as a III chord instead, but we'll talk about that when we get there, because it's not really that important a distinction.  The V/vi is the main chord that harmonizes the #5, but you could also use, say viio7/vi (measure 8), which is pretty much the same thing.  Note that the viio7/vi going to viio/V is one of those instances of a diminished 7th resolving to another diminished chord a half step <em>up</em> instead of down.</p>
<p class="text">The V/bVI in minor is less frequent because the triad is already in the key.  It normally goes to bVI (measure 15), but it can also go to iv (measure 19) or, more rarely, to V/bII (measure 24).</p>
<h4 class="question">V/bII?  What mode are we in?  I thought this was minor?</h4>
<p class="text">There is a bII and it's called the Neapolitan chord.  We'll—</p>
<h4 class="question">—talk about it soon, I know, I know.  But can't we talk about it <em>now</em>?</h4>
<p class="text">No, we'll get all sidetracked!  ...OK, fine.  The bII in major and minor is just an altered ii (or iio) chord, and it traditionally shows up in first inversion, which is why many call it the <em>Neapolitan sixth</em> and write it as N6.  I prefer to stick to bII.  Anyway, if I tell you all about it now, I'm just going to be repeating myself when we actually get to it, so let's <em>please</em> do it later?</p>
<h4 class="question">OK, OK.</h4>
<p class="text">Finally, the V/bVII.  The bVII is already not that common in Common Practice, so the V/bVII doesn't really come up.  It normally resolves to bVII (measures 25, 28), but it could surely go elsewhere instead.  The V7/bVII is actually already in the minor scale on an ascending line, but it wouldn't go to the bVII in that case since the 6 in the V/bVII would actually go to 7, not b7.  If you see the chord with the 6 going to b7, it's V/bVII rather than just IV.</p>
<p class="text">This is all of the usual secondary dominants and some of the other secondary chords.  I didn't show you an example of every single possible usage of these chords, because there's still plenty of room for creativity regarding them.  Diminished chords like viio and iio don't get secondary dominants <em>typically</em>, but of course you can break whatever rules you want in your own music, right?  The main goal of this section is to get you to recognize when these chords come up, because they're one of the principal ways in which composers from Common Practice to today's pop music use chromatic materials.</p>
<h4 class="question">Why are secondary chords so popular?</h4>
<p class="text">Because they're easy, I think.  For listeners, not necessarily composers.  We all understand the dominant function, so when we hear new notes from outside the scale, we already know where they're going when they're in a secondary dominant.  We get the excitement of a major/dominant chord from outside the scale without the confusion or the harshness.  It's a great deal!</p>
<p class="text">But now, let's look at some other chords from outside the scale, some really fun ones:</p>

<h3 class="subsection-title" id="special-chords">9.5.3 Special Chromatic Chords</h3>

<p class="text">When we modulated, we changed keys.  When we used secondary chords, we hinted at changing keys.  Now, with these chromatic chords, we ain't goin' <em>nowhere</em>.  These chords are the Neapolitan sixth, the Italian sixth, the French sixth (including its altered dominant seventh form), the German sixth, the... whatever, English/Swiss/Alsatian sixth, and the common-tone diminished chord.</p>

<? createExample('special chromatic chords'); ?>

<p class="text">The sixth chords are all pre-dominant chords, leading to V; the common-tone diminished seventh and the altered dominant seventh are dominant chords, leading to I or i.  That doesn't mean that these chords <em>have</em> to work that way, but they generally do.  These chords, and other less usual but similar chords, are essentially chromatic passing tones that grew up.  There are a whole lot of possibilities here!  These sixth chords in particular are chromatic but are very much part of Common Practice.  Beethoven especially was very into pretty much all of them.  So let's see them in action!</p>

<? createExample('special functions 1'); ?>

<p class="text">The Neapolitan sixth is often labeled N6, but I prefer to just use bII since this chord isn't really all <em>that</em> special.  In its traditional form, it's a bII in first inversion and it moves to V (measures 1, 5, 14).  It also doesn't have to show up as a sixth chord; it can simply be in root position instead (measures 3, 8), in which case you'd just call it the Neapolitan chord, since it's not a sixth.  Having it in root position can create an awkward melodic tritone in the bass (measure 3), but you can decide for yourself whether this is bad.  I personally like the sound!  I'm approaching the Neapolitan chord from i most of the time, but you can certainly approach it from anything else, including a iv6 or bVI (measure 14) or even its own secondary dominant V/bII (measure 7) or viio/bII (measure 8).  The chord is used more often in minor (measures 1, 3, 8, 9, 14) since it already has a b6, but it shows up in major as well (measure 5).  Generally, the third is doubled in four-part textures (measures 1, 3, 5, 8, 9) since the other notes are tendency tones, but the other notes can be doubled if necessary (measure 14).</p>
<p class="text">The b2 is a chromatically lowered note and therefore it tends <em>down</em>.  This is kind of weird, because if you go down from the b2 to a V chord, you go to 7, making a diminished third (measures 1, 5, 14).  In addition, if the V chord has a fifth, you end up with a cross relation (measure 5).  The doubled b2 in measure 14 allows one of those b2's to go to 2 instead, eliminating the cross relation, but since the b2 is generally not doubled, this is not the usual situation.  The b2 going to 7 might sound weird but it's part of the characteristic sound of this chord, so this b2 - 7 movement is frequently in the soprano (measures 1, 5, 14).  Sometimes, a passing chord is inserted between the bII and the V (measure 9), so the b2 goes to 1 before going to 7, but since the Neapolitan chord is pre-dominant, it almost always does move to the V (which is a bit weird since it's two major chords a tritone apart, but that's how composers like it, apparently).  That said, sometimes the b2 does resolve up!</p>
<h4 class="question">So what about the one in measure 8 that goes someplace else instead?</h4>
<p class="text">For this one, we can say that we've only elaborated the chord.  The Neapolitan harmony lasts for two measures, 8 and 9, but the chord switches position between them and there are some passing chords inserted.  By the way, see how the bass goes from Db to F and the soprano goes from F to Db, while the alto and tenor stay the same between the first and third chords (I'm ignoring the passing chord in the middle)?  This is called a <em>voice exchange</em>, and it's a very common way to get motion out of static harmony, thus lengthening the chord, or to simply reposition a chord to make going to the next chord easier.  In this case, the exchange was done with a passing chord in between, but in many cases no passing chord is used.</p>
<h4 class="question">We've already seen the bII in phrygian dominant.  Is this chord borrowed from phrygian dominant?</h4>
<p class="text">Ooh, we haven't discussed borrowing yet.  That's very soon.  But the answer is no.  In phrygian dominant, the bII is dominant and goes to I, while the Neapolitan chord is pre-dominant and goes to V (even if it passes through i on the way).  The use of the Neapolitan chord is unrelated to the bII in phrygian dominant.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 12-15 contain a sequence.  The Neapolitan chord can take the place of a iio in sequences without disturbing the pattern, which is a great way to spice things up.</p>
<p class="text">Let's move on, shall we?</p>
<p class="text">The augmented sixth chords are, to put it mildly, awesome.  Their sound is much cooler than you normally see in Common Practice music.  Part of that is because the chord is so chromatic, at least in major; you have b6 1 and #4, which contains two altered notes.  The other part is that these notes are actually enharmonically equivalent to a dominant 7th chord built on the b6, so it's a familiar sound in a new context — kind of like a chromatic mediant, actually.  Since the supposed root of these chords, the b6, is not functioning the way roots normally do in dominant 7th chords — that is, resolving a fourth up — some don't even consider the augmented sixth chord an independent sonority, instead thinking of it as a passing chord.  That's an academic distinction, though, because composers do put weight on these chords.</p>
<p class="text">The Italian, French, German, and English/Swiss/Alsatian sixth chords are all built on the same formula: b6 1 #4 with another note.  In the Italian chord, the other note is another 1, doubling it; in the French chord, it's a 2; in the German chord, it's a b3; in an English/Swiss/Alsatian chord, it's also a b3 but it's spelled as a #2 instead.  Some call the English/Swiss/Alsatian chord a doubly augmented fourth chord because it contains a doubly augmented fourth.  As much as I value proper spelling, this is a chromatic chord that depends on 12-tone equal temperament to sound good (just try it in other temperaments — yeesh), so I'm just going to call it a German chord no matter how it's spelled.</p>
<h4 class="question">Are these chords actually <em>from</em> these places?</h4>
<p class="text">Not really.  How they got these names is somewhat unknown.  Some older authors use other terms for them — Piston calls the It+6 the augmented sixth chord, the Fr+6 the augmented six-four-three chord, the Ger+6 the augmented six-five-three chord, and the English/Swiss/Alsatian chord the doubly augmented fourth chord, with a note that some theorists give them the geographical names I'm using and that "these names are not universally employed and have nothing like the established usage of the name Neapolitan sixth, for instance."  To be sure, they <em>are</em> universally used today, even if they weren't in Piston's time.  The Neapolitan sixth chord is actually related to music from Naples, so that's at least something.  A good mnemonic to remember the names is simply the north-south geographical position of the countries in question: Italy is to the south, so it gets the low note added, the 1; France is central so it gets the middle note, the 2; Germany is to the north so it gets the upper note, the b3.</p>
<p class="text">(I just checked a map of Europe.  That's really where those countries are.  Phew.)</p>
<h4 class="question">What about England/Switzerland/Alsace?</h4>
<p class="text">England is just a fanciful name; Switzerland is part French and part German, so that makes sense for a #2; Alsace is on the French border with Germany and presumably some sort of similar logic exists there.  In any case, we're not going to heavily depend on these names and we'll just call it a differently-spelled German augmented sixth.</p>
<p class="text">Back to actual music theory, these chords are pre-dominant and resolve to the V.  However, their notes can still be arranged in a tertian manner.  The It+6 is #4 b6 1; the Ger+6 is #4 b6 1 b3; the Fr+6 is 2 #4 b6 1; the differently-spelled Ger+6 is #2 #4 b6 1.  To this we'll add the common-tone diminished 7th, which we'll get to in a minute, which is spelled #2 #4 6 1.  For the actual augmented 6th chords, if we use the usual Ger+6 spelling, they're all subsets of a V7b5b9/V: (2) #4 b6 1 (b3).  If we want to, we can think of the aug6 chords as possibly rootless altered V/V's.</p>
<p class="text">As Roman numerals, there are different ways to do this.  Piston, for example, labels the doubly augmented fourth chord with II 6# 4# 3.  I guess if you're used to seeing that it's not so bad, but <em>ugh</em>.  Some just have It+6, Fr+6, and Ger+6, but this makes it difficult to refer to inversions.  Laitz's The Complete Musician uses It, Fr, and Ger with the inversion numbers, so that's what I'll do; in their traditional positions, the chords are It6, Fr43, and Ger65.  I'll still call them It+6, etc. in text when I don't care to specify the inversion.  So let's see how these guys behave!</p>

<? createExample('special functions 2'); ?>

<p class="text">As I said earlier, the aug6 chords resolve to V, with the augmented sixth interval between the b6 and #4 resolving outward to a 5 - 5 octave (measures 2, 3, 5, 20, 28, 33).  This produces a problem with the Ger65, because with the b6 in the bass going down to 5 and the b3 in one of the upper voices going down to 2, you get parallel fifths (measure 5).   Mozart's solution to this problem was... to just write parallel fifths.  Come on, it's Mozart.  The more common solution, though, is to first resolve to I64 (measure 7) or i64 (measure 17) before proceeding to V.  The augmented sixth chords are generally used both in major and minor; in minor, the b3 of the Ger65 just stays when the chord moves to i64, but in major, the b3 goes up to 3.  This is the reverse of the usual tendency of altered tones to move in the direction of their alteration, so the b3 is respelled as #2 for this purpose.  You won't find the English/Swiss/Alsatian chord in minor because it's just not necessary to make that spelling change.  Alternatively, the Ger65 could resolve to V7 with the b3 going up to 4 (<? exampleLink('secondary functions 4'); ?> measure 17, but that's an altered V7).  The #4 in the chord sometimes goes down to 4 then 3 instead (measure 23).  If you have a Ger65 going to a V7 this way, you'll just have the entire chord moving down a half step, which is unusual in Common Practice but not so much in popular music and jazz.</p>
<p class="text">Aug6 chords are occasionally found in inversion.  The most common is the Ger7 (measure 16), which has the #4 in the bass; some call it a diminished third chord because of the d3 between the #4 and b6.  The other aug6 chords could also be inverted, like the It53 (measure 14) and Ger7 (measure 16).</p>
<h4 class="question">Why is it It53 and not just It?</h4>
<p class="text">Eh, it could be, but since this is a nonstandard symbol, I figured it's best to be explicit.  If I write Ger43, you can probably figure out what I meant even if you're unfamiliar with this way of notating inverted aug6 chords, but with It on its own, it's not clear that I mean a structure that resembles a root position triad instead of, say, a regular Italian chord that I just didn't feel like writing a 6 next to.</p>
<p class="text">One uncommon use of the aug6 chord is the so-called <em>common-tone augmented sixth</em>, which is an aug6 chord that goes to I (or i) instead of V (measure 28).  Honestly, that's not actually different from a Ger65 resolving to a I64, but the idea is that the 1 in the aug6 chord stays in place as the chord moves to I, often in the bass, and the b6 and #4 resolve to 5 as normal.  It's just like Ger65 to I64 except everything is inverted so that the I64 is not in second inversion.  Since the aug6 is still a pre-dominant chord, this is pre-dominant to tonic motion and is therefore plagal.  We'll talk about that later.</p>
<p class="text">Just one semitone away from the common-tone augmented sixth is the <em>common-tone diminished seventh</em>, or cto7 (also available in inversions, obviously).  This chord is a diminished seventh built on the #2, such that it has a 1, and it resolves to I (measures 29, 31).  The #2 goes up to 3, the #4 goes up to 5, and the 6 goes down to 5.  ii7 - cto7 - I6 is a common ragtime-type ending (usually the I6 has an added 6 instead of a doubled 5).  Note that the only difference between the cto65 resolving to I64 and a viio7/V resolving to I64 is that the cto65 has a #2 while the viio7/V has a b3 — in other words, there isn't any difference.  It's the same damn chord.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 10-12 have something similar to what I did in an arrangement once, and the analysis stumped the fuck out of me for years.  I'm not even satisfied with what I have now.  If you play the first three chords backwards, you have ii7 - Ger42 - I6, making the Ger42 a common-tone augmented sixth.  But we're not playing the chords backwards; we're playing them forwards.  If it were backwards, the chord would be spelled D# F# C Ab, an unmistakable English/Swiss/Alsatian sixth chord resolving by common tone, but it's not going in that direction, so we have this chord with Eb Gb C G#, which has two kinds of G's.  It's a nonsensical chord, honestly; it's a chord made out of voice leading.  And yet it sounds so good!</p>
<h4 class="question">Do aug6 chords <em>have</em> to be built on the b6 and resolve to V?  Can't you have aug6 chords resolving to other chords?</h4>
<p class="text">Turns out you can, but it's very rare in Common Practice.  In jazz, it's very common, kinda.  We'll get to that later.  Here, though, we have the altered V7, the FrV (measures 11, 24).  This is literally nothing more than V7b5, but it looks like an augmented sixth chord built on the b2, so it gets this FrV designation; it resolves to I (or i).  It's highly unusual in Common Practice but not entirely unheard of, so while I'm calling it FrV because Laitz does, most theory books I've come across don't even mention it.  In contrast, in jazz, the idea of using a bIIdom7 instead of a V7 is called a <em>tritone substitution</em>, and tritone subs are all over the place.  The cool thing about the French sixth is that the chord is symmetric, containing two tritones: b6 - 2 and 1 - #4.  This means that the French sixth built on one note is enharmonically equivalent to the French sixth built on the note a tritone away.  The FrV could be seen as either a V7b5 or a bIIdom7b5; the two are enharmonically the same chord.  The V is the more accurate spelling, though.  You also don't need to have a French V; a GerV will do just fine (measure 26), though you'll have to deal with parallel fifths.</p>
<h4 class="question">Is the GerV still a V even though it doesn't have a 5?</h4>
<p class="text">Eh, who cares?  The point is that you can put augmented sixth chords on the b2 instead of the b6 and have it resolve to I instead of V.</p>
<p class="text">You can also have <em>secondary</em> aug6 chords.  I've never seen this in books, so my notation is going to be awkward.  It does not appear that there is a standard notation.  The problem is that the aug6 chords are <em>already</em> secondary chords, so if I'm resolving to the V/V, is it a Fr/V or a Fr/V/V?  I went with the latter (measure 33).  The assumption, then, is that a regular Fr is actually a Fr/V, and a FrV is actually a Fr/I.  You can likewise have secondary cto7 chords.</p>
<p class="text">The aug6 chord in general can be thought of as an elaboration of the IV6 chord (measure 1), but you can really approach it from anywhere.  Chromatic lines are always nice, which is why the IV6 and ii43 chords are attractive options, having a 6 and a 4 that proceed to b6 and #4, but maybe you're tired of chromatic lines by now, I don't know!  Chromatic lines are great for smooth voice leading but are shit for melodies; they connect chords very satisfyingly, but you're gonna want something more exciting to actually be in the foreground.  In measure 23, the Ger65 is approached from a iii, meaning that the 3 in the bass of the iii jumps up a diminished fourth to the b6 of the Ger65.  <em>That's</em> interesting.  The other voices, not so much.</p>
<p class="text">The Neapolitan and augmented sixth chords can also be used in modulation, often by means of some enharmonic trickery:</p>

<? createExample('special functions 3'); ?>

<p class="text">The Neapolitan chord can be any major chord in some other key (measure 2), and any major chord can be the Neapolitan chord in the target key (measures 7, 9).  Similarly, an augmented sixth chord can be any dominant seventh in some other key (measure 6), and any dominant seventh can be the augmented sixth chord in the target key (measure 11).  Obviously for the aug6 = dom7 modulations you need some enharmonic interpretation, but this allows you to jump pretty far harmonically.  Measure 2 in particular has the bII6 actually turn into a secondary dominant, so that's another thing you can do.  It's useful for continuity when at least some of the chord members keep their tendencies, like the b2 in measure 2 still resolving down, even though the resolution is in a new key.</p>
<p class="text">In early Common Practice music, where the only available keys for modulation are the related ones (±1 accidental, relative, and parallel), these chords are not used for modulation, since they end up modulating to keys that are farther away, but later on, these chords provide a wealth of possibility for smoothly and interestingly going from one place to somewhere completely different.  There are only a few examples here, but you should try to see how outlandish a modulation you can make.</p>
<p class="text">These are the special chromatic chords used in Common Practice music.  They sit outside the diatonic Roman numeral system, for the most part, especially the aug6 chords that are inherently non-tertian, and while (early) Common Practice music specifically doesn't go beyond them, that doesn't mean that <em>you</em> can't.  For example, the aug6 chords are all spelled b6 1 #4; what if you did b6 7 #4 instead?  If you remember the Tristan chord from <? exampleLink('special chords'); ?>, that's basically an aug6 chord with a 7 instead of a 1 (it resolves to the 1 like an appoggiatura, though, but still).  You can get creative with these chords made out of voice leading without destroying the sense of function in the harmony, which is what makes them especially useful.  All the awesomeness of chromaticism without getting lost.  But now, we're going into the mirror dimension...</p>

<h3 class="subsection-title" id="modal-interchange">9.5.4 Modal Interchange</h3>

<p class="text">I'm going to tell you a secret.  Ready?</p>
<h4 class="question">No.</h4>
<p class="text">Too bad.  Here goes: you don't have to stay within the mode.</p>
<h4 class="question">No duh.  What the hell kind of secret is that?</h4>
<p class="text">What I mean is that you can mix different modes and smoothly use the chords of one mode in another.  This means that you can use the chords from C minor while you're in C major, and vice-versa.</p>
<h4 class="question">Yes, we already knew this.  It's called borrowing.  That's why we can use the b6 in the aug6 chords in major; the b6 is borrowed from minor.</h4>
<p class="text">...No.  Not at all.</p>
<h4 class="question">OK, explain it then.</h4>
<p class="text">The reason I wanted to deal with the special chromatic chords first is that they're <em>not</em> borrowed.  <em>Modal interchange</em>, also known as <em>borrowing</em>, is when you take a chord <em>with function</em> in a <em>parallel</em> mode and use it with the same function in the current mode.  For example, if you're in C major and you use an Fm chord as a subdominant, that's a borrowed iv from minor.  On the other hand, if you're in C minor and you use a C major chord to get to Fm, that C major chord is a V/iv; it's not borrowed from major.  It gets worse when you start talking about modes other than major and minor, because <em>some</em> people will justify a C7 going to F in C major as being borrowed from mixolydian, which is just ridiculous — it's a fucking secondary dominant, goddammit!</p>
<p class="text">Modal interchange tends to come up in discussions that look like this: "I used a chord but it's not in the key; how does it still sound good?"  "Oh, it's because it's borrowed from the parallel Hungarian minor b2."  "Ah, yes, that completely explains things and answers all of my questions in a reasonable manner, thank you!"</p>
<h4 class="question">Hungarian minor b2?</h4>
<p class="text">Random scale.  Hungarian minor goes 1 2 b3 #4 5 b6 7, which is a mode of the double harmonic scale, but with a b2, so it goes 1 b2 b3 #4 5 b6 7.  It's not exactly a popular scale.  In Arabic music, the 1 b2 b3 #4 5 pentachord is an Athar Kurd jins, and the upper 5 b6 7 1 tetrachord is a Hijaz jins, making maqam Athar Kurd (see <? sectionLinkShort('maqamat nawa athar'); ?>).  Whatever, the scale doesn't matter.  The point is that this doesn't answer any questions!</p>
<p class="text">In (early-to-mid) Common Practice music, the only modes available are major and minor, so these are the modes that get interchanged.  We'll talk about the more general case a bit later.  What this means is that, in major, we get to use chords from minor, like i, iio, bIII, iv, v, bVI, vio, bVII, and viio7, and in minor we get to use chords from major, like... I, iii, and vi.  And ii and IV and viiø7, I guess, without the restriction on the 6 moving up to 7.  Minor chords are found in major more often than major chords are found in minor, for the simple reason that minor is already full of variety while major has less.  There are a few exceptions, which we'll talk about.</p>
<p class="text">Let's see these borrowed chords in action:</p>

<? createExample('borrowed functions 1'); ?>

<p class="text">We start in measures 1-3 with a borrowed iiø7 chord.  It goes to V, like it normally would in minor, and it comes from IV, which in minor would have been iv but it's equivalent.  It can make more sense sometimes to talk about borrowed <em>notes</em> than chords, so this iiø7 contains a borrowed b6.  The b6 is a popular note to borrow in major because it's new and interesting but doesn't destroy the tonality of the mode; that's also why the b6 is used in the aug6 chords (though in that case it isn't borrowed).</p>
<p class="text">In measures 4-7, we have a borrowed bIII, which goes to IV just like mediant chords often do.  The I - bIII - IV - Ger+6 (or bVI) progression is similar to the one used in The Animals' <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjsGFM-sVbE">House of the Rising Sun</a>, and in general, bIII - IV is quite big in pop music.  My example is actually backwards from House of the Rising Sun, though: the song goes i - bIII - IV - bVI, so it's actually the IV that's borrowed from major, not the bIII and bVI from minor.  It doesn't make a real difference, though, because the effect is that the actual mode is ambiguous.  Is it minor borrowing from major or is it major borrowing from minor?  It's kind of both and neither.  This confusion is why I call the chord bIII in minor rather than III, like some authors do.  For those authors, the chord is built on the third degree of the minor scale, so it should be III, but my convention is to refer only to the degrees of the major scale, so bIII is the same chord regardless of which mode we're in, because it's not always clear which mode we're in!</p>
<h4 class="question">If House of the Rising Sun uses a bVI, why did you use a Ger7 instead?</h4>
<p class="text">Because I wanted to do my own thing — I'm allowed, right?  Also, parallel fifths.  I'm trying to demonstrate proper voice leading, and pop music doesn't usually require proper voice leading due to the instrumentation.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 8-10 feature a borrowed iv.  This is a <em>very</em> common chord in cadences, since the 4 and b6 are just a half step each away from 3 and 5, respectively.  A particularly popular cadential formula is IV - iv - I, though if the composer wants it to be more poignant, it could go IV - iiø7 - I.  Note by the way that the second chord in measure 8 is <em>not</em> a borrowed bVII but rather a IV/IV, though admittedly the line is blurry.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 11-13 have a borrowed v.  v is not an incredibly common chord in minor, but it does come up, especially as v6 over a descending bass.  You could, if you wanted to, analyze it as ii6/IV, but I don't see the point since it's acting as a v6 normally would.  Here, the b7 is borrowed; remember that the b7 in minor goes down to b6, not up to 1.  We can also let it go down to 6 or leap somewhere else, but be careful when it goes up, because it if goes to 1, depending on the harmony, it may not be in the minor mode.</p>
<h4 class="question">And why does this matter?</h4>
<p class="text">Funny thing: it doesn't.  At all.  But in Common Practice, b7 - 1 was just not done when the 1 was a i chord (but in a iv or bVI, it was OK).  b7 - 1 was seen as a weak cadence compared to 7 - 1, which is why the leading tone was always raised (the exception being in phrygian, where b7 - 1 was OK because the important part of the cadence was on the other side, the b2 - 1).  In more modern music, b7 - 1 is perfectly fine, and we'll talk about all the possibilities that opens up in a bit.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 15-17 have a borrowed bVI, coming after a V7 like in a deceptive cadence, and proceeding to a ii chord like the submediant does.  bVI has been frequently borrowed from Bach to pop music.  We talked about the b6 being a common note for borrowing; the b7 is a bit less common in classical music but very common in rock (where the music should probably just be said to be in mixolydian).  The b3 is fundamental to the major mode, so when it shows up, it's usually either to harmonize something that needs it, like the bVI, or it's to deliberately make the mode ambiguous, like in the bIII.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 18-20 have a borrowed bVII, which happens a lot in pop music but usually going up to I rather than down, which we're not talking about just yet since Common Practice insists on proper leading tones.  Here, it goes to bVI7, another borrowed chord, so this passage is a bit ambiguous.  In real music, there'd be more context.  Probably.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 21-22 feature a borrowed viio65.  Honestly, it's been tough to not use this chord all over the place in the previous examples.  viio7 chords are <em>very</em> common in major despite being diatonic to minor.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 23-26 have a borrowed i.  This is a contrived example, because a i in major generally indicates a modal shift rather than a borrowed chord, since the function of the i is as the tonic.  (The same is not true in reverse, as we'll see momentarily.)</p>
<p class="text">In measures 27-29 we have a borrowed IVdom7, which is one of those weird chords that depends on melodic minor, and it's going to V as it should, with the 6 going up to 7 as it also should.  The IVdom7 is <em>not</em> a V7/bVII, as we can see by how it resolves to V instead of bVII.  It's acting as a pre-dominant, which is why we analyze it as a kind of IV and not a secondary dominant.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 30-31 there's a iiø42 going to I, which is a plagal resolution that is very common in popular music.  In this four-part context, it makes sense to double the 1, but in pop music the b6 is often doubled and in the bass.  My way has smoother voice leading, but, remember, smooth voice leading is boring voice leading.</p>
<h4 class="question">Why do you do it, then, if it's boring?</h4>
<p class="text">Because being boring is good when you're in the background.  The background should generally be as boring as possible while supporting the foreground, who are the real stars of the show.  The more interesting the background, the lass prominent the foreground.  Yet, the background still needs to give the proper shape to the foreground; interesting harmonies will make the song interesting because the lead participates in the harmony, but interesting voice leading will steal the spotlight away from the lead.</p>
<p class="text">Finally, measures 32-33 have the weird V chord with two thirds, because why not?  You can borrow anything you want!</p>
<p class="text">Let's see what happens now when we're in minor and we borrow chords from major:</p>

<? createExample('borrowed functions 2'); ?>

<h4 class="question">It doesn't sound as cool for some reason...</h4>
<p class="text">Yeah, it really doesn't, for the most part.  That's why borrowing from major is more rare.  In major, we don't have a b3, b6, or b7, so borrowing chords gives us new sonorities.  In minor, we actually have both 6 and b6 and both b7 and 7, so it's only the 3 that's new and interesting, and even that is actually very commonplace as we'll see in a minute.  The only real borrowing we can do without destroying the mode is borrowing chords with a 3 or a 6, so that's ii, iii, IV, vi, viiø7, and I.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 1-2 borrow the ii7 in an otherwise normal i - ii42 - V65 - i progression.  Not a big deal.  The kind of weird thing, though, is the cross relation between the ii42 and V65.</p>
<h4 class="question">What cross relation?  There are no notes that change accidentals from one chord to the other.  Do you mean the tritone between the F and the B?</h4>
<p class="text">Actually, the tritone between the Eb in the i and the A in the ii42 is a bit awkward, but no, I'm talking about the 6 in the ii42 and the 7 in the V65 that happens in a different voice.  It's not the same kind of cross relation that we were talking about earlier, but it <em>is</em> a relation between two notes in different voices where the logic of the mode indicates that one note should go to the next.  The raised 6th in the ii42 is "supposed" to go to the raised 7th, but instead that 7 appears in another voice.  However, the 6 is behaving as it does in major, going down to the 5 without problems, and <em>that</em> is borrowed behavior.  This ii42 is borrowed rather than simply featuring the raised 6th in minor because of how that 6th behaves.  If you find the 6 behaving that way in minor, it's either borrowed from major or you're actually in dorian... which we'll discuss later.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 3-6 feature a borrowed iii7.  Why iii7 and not just iii?  Voice leading.  Good reason, right?  The iii7 goes to iv, and it sounds kind of weird because the iii is so harmonically distant from the tonic i chord (it's a chromatic mediant).  iii going to iv is similarly unusual, being two minor chords a half step apart.  Interestingly, I was able to work in a v7 in measure 5 that actually behaves correctly in minor!  The problem with the v7 is that the b7 has to go down, so the v7 doesn't go to i.  But there's nothing stopping it from going to viio7, which is what happens here.  I'm proud of finding a mode-consistent use for this chord.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 7-9 may sound like they're taken right out of some old 16-bit game, like, really early in the generation, but actually, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBuXfcFKAlo">it only sounds like it does because the chords in Mute City from F-Zero are a little different</a>.</p>
<h4 class="question">SiIvaGunner had this high quality videogame rip of Mute City...  I miss that channel.</h4>
<p class="text">Me too, man.  Me too.  The big star here is the IV chord, which calls to mind the dorian mode.  Early Common Period doesn't really dig the dorian sound, in part because of that cross relation of the tritone between the b3 and the 6, but later on, the borrowed IV was, and still is, a huge hit.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 10-13 have a borrowed vi, which is a great option for going to iio or iv: the 3 is chromatically altered from the b3 in the mode, so it wants to resolve up to 4, and the 6, which is... less altered, I guess, can go down chromatically to the b6.</p>
<p class="text">In measures 14-15 there's a borrowed viiø7, and, to be honest, I think it's terrible.  The viiø7 chord is not usually present in minor, since viio7 with the b6 is just so much better.  Maybe I could have used a different voicing.  Feel free to play around with it yourself.  I just don't think it really works.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 16-17 are your average i - iiø7 - V65 - i, except this time the final chord is I instead.  THIS IS A BIG DEAL.</p>
<h4 class="question">IS THIS A BIG DEAL?</h4>
<p class="text">YES, I JUST TOLD YOU IT WAS; DID YOU THINK I WAS LYING?</p>
<h4 class="question">SORRY!</h4>
<p class="text">In older music, like, pre-Baroque, all cadences ended on a major chord.  All of them, even in music in minor modes.  Hell, even in phrygian.  The raised third in minor modes was (and still is) called the <em>Picardy third</em>.  At the end of most pieces in minor in Common Practice, and that's not just early Common Practice but the whole period, you should expect to find a major I chord featuring that Picardy third.  Pieces ending on a minor i are actually rare for, say, Bach, which is one of the reasons people came up with to dispute the authorship of his Toccata and Fugue in D minor, which ends on a big D minor chord and not a D major like one would expect.  Until now, I've been sticking to i for minor cadences in the examples, but, say, measure 13 would probably be a I in real music as opposed to a i.  Maybe measure 6 too.  Certainly measure 20, but I wanted to demonstrate a different principle there.  Picardy thirds are <em>really</em> common.  So common, in fact, that I've been regretting my decision to not mention them way up when we discussed the I chord in <? sectionLinkShort('analysis roman root'); ?>, but not enough to actually do it, because I wanted to stay diatonic in that section.  The I chord in minor probably shouldn't be considered a borrowed chord.</p>
<p class="text">By the way, if the I chord shows up in minor <em>not</em> at a cadence, it's most likely a V/iv instead.  So be aware of that.</p>
<p class="text">Finally, in measures 18-20, we borrow a vø43 from phrygian dominant just because we can.  This wouldn't happen in (early) Common Practice, but it <em>is</em> technically a possibility.  You see that the vø43 is resolving just like it normally does in phrygian dominant, except that the chord of resolution is a i rather than a I.  You may be asking why it's a i and not a I, and the answer is simply that I wanted to keep the minor context prominent.  If the final chord had been I, it would have sounded more like a full modal shift than a borrowed chord.  To remind you, a modal shift is when you actually change modes; modal interchange (or borrowing) is when you just take some of the functionality from another mode.</p>
<h4 class="question">Can you borrow secondary chords?</h4>
<p class="text">Yes, actually:</p>

<? createExample('borrowed functions 3'); ?>

<p class="text">Measures 1-3 there's a iv6/IV.  The key of the IV doesn't have a iv; it has a IV, so we've borrowed the iv chord from the parallel minor <em>of the key of the IV</em>.  It's a <em>secondary</em> modal interchange!</p>
<p class="text">Measures 4-7 we have something that's actually very common in Common Practice music: descending dim7 chords (including the viio7/V, which is a borrowed chord since the key of the V has a viiø7, not a viio7).  The truth is that the Roman numerals here are not really useful, but the progression is a circle of fifths sequence.  You know how a viio7 is really a V7b9 without the root?  What we actually have here is a V7b9 of V of V of V resolving (normally) to a V7b9 of V of V, which also resolves normally to a V7b9 of V, which resolves normally to V7b9, which resolves normally to I.  Except all these chords are rootless.  This functional explanation is superfluous, though, because all that's really happening is a bunch of dim7 chords in a row descending chromatically.  When a whole chord moves around with its intervals intact (or mostly intact, at least), it's called <em>planing</em>.  These specific chords are symmetric, so the feeling of root motion is lost with the planing, even though you can rationalize what the roots could have been.  This is a nice trick for modulation too, since the ear doesn't remember what key you were in before, so you can just go to some dim7 chord, respell it enharmonically (or not), and off you go wherever you please.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 8-10 have a similar thing going, but this time the chords are going up, not down.  This one relies on a different kind of trickery: substitute chords.  The viio/vi wants to resolve to vi, but that vi gets replaced with a dim7 chord instead.  There's some enharmonic shenanigans going on here, but again, the precise Roman numeral functions are kind of besides the point in this kind of sequence.  The descending sequence works like this: the dim7 chord is 7 2 4 b6, with the 7 traditionally going to 1 and the 4 traditionally going to 3, but the 7 goes to b7 instead, just like with sequences of dominant 7th chords, and the other notes fill in the rest of the chord; the 3 becomes the new 7 and the b7 becomes the new 4.  In the ascending sequence, the 7 wants to go to 1 and the 2 wants to go to b3, with the rest of the notes filling in the rest of the chord; the 1 becomes the new 7 and the b3 becomes the new 2.  The problem is that if the 7 keeps going up chromatically, we'll have too many accidentals, so it's usually best if we deploy some strategic enharmonic equivalents here and there. especially since it doesn't actually <em>matter</em> which note is the 7 in a symmetric chord.  The descending dim7's are more common than the ascending ones.  (Note that if they descend in whole steps rather than half steps, that's equivalent to them ascending in half steps due to the symmetry of the chord.)</p>
<p class="text">The viio7/vii is one of those functions that would never make sense in Common Practice, since the vii can't be tonicized due to being diminished, but in a sense, that <em>is</em> what's happening here.  You can make your own conclusions.  The fact is that the functionality of the progression is technically there but it's lost to the ear.</p>
<p class="text">Finally, measures 11-14 have a borrowed vi7 in minor — which we've seen already — but it's preceded by a V43/vi, which is a secondary chord to a borrowed chord.</p>
<p class="text">In a sense, secondary chords and borrowed chords are complementary technologies: the secondary chord is taken from a key with some other tonic, while the borrowed chord is taken from a different mode on the same tonic.  Both are ways to get chromatic material imported into an otherwise diatonic context.  We just have one more way left to do that within Common Practice, though by this point we're kind of at the edges of that music:</p>

<h3 class="subsection-title" id="altered-chords">9.5.5 Altered Chords</h3>

<p class="text">Altered chords are more of an umbrella term than anything else for chords that are functional but aren't diatonic, especially if they've had chromatic alterations.  Possibilities here include the III and VI chords, V+ and I+ chords, and other alterations.  A lot of the time they come from chromatic passing tones or other tendency tones.  An example we've already seen is the FrV chord in <? sectionLinkShort('analysis roman special'); ?>, which is a V7 with a lowered fifth that now looks like an aug6 chord that resolves to the tonic instead of the dominant.  Let's see them in action:</p>

<? createExample('altered functions 1'); ?>

<p class="text">These are fun, but we're getting pretty far from the basic standards of Common Practice.  Still, these altered chords <em>are</em> functional, and this kind of stuff was used all the time in the late 19th century, which was technically still Common Practice, right?  This is only a small selection, because we have to leave something for when we really do completely abandon Common Practice tonality in the next section, but they're fun chords!</p>
<p class="text">The main star here is the augmented triad.  The raised fifth has a strong tendency to resolve up.  We've already seen the bIII+ triad in minor, which is really more of a V chord with a suspended b6, but when we enharmonically spell it as V+, now the #2 wants very badly to resolve to 3 in the I chord.  In measures 1-4, we have just that in measure 1 (over a pedal 1), and in measure 3 it happens again with an added ninth.</p>
<h4 class="question">These measures sound familiar...</h4>
<p class="text">I hope so!  They're a four-voice adaptation of the chords from the beginning of Duke Ellington's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GohBkHaHap8">Mood Indigo</a>.  That was originally played by two trombones and a bass clarinet, but I'm doing these examples in four voices so I added another one in the bass.  In addition to the V+ chords, though, there's one that's really weird, the bIII6 in measure 3, which is actually being analyzed enharmonically since it has a #2 rather than a b3.  Normally, a bIII - V avoids the cross relation by having the b7 go to the 7, but here it goes down instead, and the 7 needs to come from another voice.  Since the voice leading is mostly pretty smooth anyway, I'm calling this an irregular chord motion as opposed to saying it's just non-functional.  Another way to analyze it is to hear it as a v#5, which is also how it's spelled so maybe that's the better option.  The b7 is definitely doing some weird stuff in this chord.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 5-7 show a I+ chord in its home environment: as a result of a line cliché.  A <em>line cliché</em> is when several members of a chord stay still and another voice moves up or down in a chromatic or scalar line.  The I+ in particular comes from a I chord where the 5 goes chromatically up to 6, and possibly back down like in this example, but it could go to b7 instead or anywhere else.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 8-15 are an adaptation of the harmony from the introduction of Chico Buarque's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPTOAYyt8BU">O Que Será</a> (find a version with Milton Nascimento, seriously).  The original is more complex, but we don't need to get into that.  What happens here is, roughly, i - v - iv - bvi - iiø - V.  The first three chords have a descending chromatic line cliché in alternating voice parts, so you get some great altered sevenths and such.  The added 6th in the second chords of measures 9 and 13 are difficult to analyze using Roman numerals, but since they actually still work as first inversion 7th chords, we can kick that can down the road.  The real reason this example is here, though, is measure 15: the bvi chord.  This is an altered bVI, only with a minor third instead of a major third.  You may think that it's not functional, but it resolves to the supertonic, like submediant chords usually do, so it's definitely functioning as a submediant.  It's pretty rare to get a b1 in functional music, but there you go!</p>
<p class="text">Measures 16-19 have a III, which is a iii with a raised third, but honestly, most people would analyze it as a V/vi.  It's going to IV, as iii chords do, but we've already established that this also works as a deceptive resolution to a V/vi resolving to bVI/vi, which is IV, so whatever.  Somewhat more interesting is the second chord at 18, which has both a lowered fifth and a raised fifth.  The V7 with a lowered fifth is the FrV, but this isn't a V7.  That said... who cares?  You could consider it to be a FrV65 with an added... whatever note that is.  x1?  That is a doubly diminished octave between the D# and the Db.  As an aug6 chord, you'd have Db D# G B, which is still an aug6 chord, just with extra fun notes.  We'll see some more examples of aug6 chords with extra fun notes a bit later.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 20-23 have a VI chord, which is an altered vi.  It's <em>not</em> a V/ii because of the way it's tonicized and isn't implying the ii at all.  Rather, it's more of a chromatic mediant to the I than anything else, but it's still performing its submediant function in the key.</p>
<p class="text">Many, many, many more altered chords are possible.  The question is whether they fit within our functional framework.  It's perfectly OK to write non-functional harmony, and function comes in many other forms that we'll explore in the next section, but at some point, using Roman numerals to analyze harmony becomes irrelevant.  In this chapter we're focusing on the kinds of harmony for which Roman numerals <em>are</em> appropriate, so while you can of course go as crazy as you want with the chords, you don't get the benefit of the functional harmonic framework when you do.  Function is something we already understand from growing up with Western music; when we depart from functionality too much, we lose that point of reference.  If we want to go wild, though, we don't <em>have</em> to give up functionality entirely.  We can modulate extremely often, for example, such that chord 1 and chord 2 are functionally related, chord 2 and chord 3 are functionally related, and chord 1 and chord 3 are unrelated.  Or we can use occasional non-functional chords in an otherwise functional context.  But one thing's for sure: having easy Roman numerals is no reason to stifle your creativity!</p>

<h3 class="subsection-title" id="preludes">9.5.6 Three Preludes</h3>

<p class="text">Now that we know how to analyze any Common Practice functional harmony, let's actually apply our skills to some Common Practice music!  We'll look at three keyboard preludes, one by Bach from 1722, one by Beethoven from 1801, and one by Chopin from 1839.  All three are extremely famous pieces that you're likely to have heard even if you aren't into classical music, and if you've played piano at all you've probably played them.</p>
<h4 class="question">Preludes to what?  Doesn't a prelude have to come before something?</h4>
<p class="text">That's what the word means, but as a musical form, a prelude is (generally) a piece of music based on a single idea or pattern that keeps repeating in different harmonies.  These preludes in particular have either no melody to speak of or have a very minimal melody.  If you remember from <? sectionLinkShort('composition layers'); ?>, the melody is more important to the ear than the harmony, meaning that a melody — not even necessarily a good one — can easily hide and justify a non-remarkable harmony.  If you take the melody away, however, the harmony comes to the fore, and since our goal in this chapter is to analyze harmony, a prelude is an ideal vehicle for interesting harmonic progressions with minimal distraction, and that's what we have here!  To be fair, the Beethoven piece isn't <em>labeled</em> a prelude, but... it is.  We all know that it is.  We'll see it when we get there (no points for guessing it right — it's pretty obvious where I'm going with this).</p>
<p class="text">So let's get started.  The first piece is one we've seen parts of a few times, including in <? exampleLink('WTC Prelude 1'); ?>, J. S. Bach's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aengbLEFnM8">Prelude 1 in C major</a>, from the Well-Tempered Clavier, Book I.  The Well-Tempered Clavier, Book I is a collection of 24 pairs of preludes and fugues, one pair in each major and minor key going up chromatically, some of which we've already seen in past sections.  The very first thing in this collection is this prelude, the one in C major.  (Bach later composed another collection similar to the first, which is the Well-Tempered Clavier, Book II.  Clever title, I know.)  Many of the preludes are complex and have many things going on, though, being preludes, they tend to keep a similar texture throughout, but for the opening piece, Bach kept it very simple, with only a repeating arpeggio pattern that plays each of the chords in this piece (until the ending, anyway).  There's no melody, just chords, making it a great exercise for harmonic analysis.  Here's the piece:</p>

<? createExample('Prelude 1 Book I'); ?>

<p class="text">The first thing <em>you</em> need to do is make sure that all of these Roman numeral symbols make sense to you.  If one of them doesn't, is it because you don't understand it or is it because you disagree with my analysis?  One example of where you might disagree is at measure 11, where I decided the modulation back to the tonic begins.  Maybe you think it begins elsewhere.  But do you actually understand what the numbers mean and how they line up with the chords?</p>
<h4 class="question">I...  I think so.</h4>
<p class="text">All right, great!  It's unfortunate that I can't actually make you do your own analyses, but that's something you really ought to do in order to learn this stuff.</p>
<p class="text">The first and most obvious thing that we notice about this piece is how repetitive the pattern is, though the chord progression itself is not particularly repetitive.  Instead, what we have are five-part chords (bass, tenor, alto, mezzo, soprano), one per measure, broken up in an arpeggio.  There are only three voices actually sounding at once — the bass and tenor both hold their notes, while the right hand plays a figuration consisting of three different pitches in a figuration, making a five-part chord, and the chord is played exactly the same way twice every measure except the last three.  This means that we can very easily track the voice leading in the five voices.</p>
<p class="text">Going through the piece, we have a standard — and archetypal — phrase in the first four bars: I - ii42 - V65 - I.  This introduces the pattern of the piece, and it makes it so that anything that happens after this is development.  When we talked about sonata form above in <? sectionLinkShort('analysis roman modulation'); ?>, we talked about the three sections of sonata form: exposition, where the main themes are played straight (generally there are two of them, the second being in the key of the dominant), development, where the thematic material gets broken down, and recapitulation, where the themes are restated in modified form and end on the tonic.  This prelude is not in sonata form, but the main idea still holds: present some material straight before playing with it, so that the listener understands what you're playing with.  The first four bars serve this purpose.  Since every measure in the piece (before the last three) is effectively the same, just with different chords, stating a simple phrase in this pattern serves to establish the pattern so that when the later material plays with the harmony, it can be heard in reference to the original statement.</p>
<p class="text">Right away after this introduction, we get a vi6 chord in measure 5.  The bass has been relatively static so far: it's been on C for four out of the first five measures.  vi6 is relatively unusual because it sounds too similar to a I chord, but with the root doubled and in the soprano, you can't really make that mistake.  However, our suspicions pay off when in measure 6 we get a V42/V — still with the C in the bass.</p>
<h4 class="question">V42/V?  You just have V42, with a modulation in measure 5.  Is that a typo?</h4>
<p class="text">Hold on, we're getting to that!  In measure 7, the V42/V resolves to V6, and in measures 8-11 we finally understand what's happening: we're in the key of the dominant!  We have a very strong ii7 - V7 - I in G, which is pretty unmistakably a modulation.  Looking back, the V42/V is a bit weird as a secondary dominant, because while the V6 at measure 7 does go to the tonic in measure 8, the tonic is a 42 chord.  The most logical place to label the modulation, in my opinion, is at measure 5, where that slightly unusual vi6 in the key of C is recognized as a much more common ii6 in the key of G.  Then we can easily reinterpret the other chords and they make more sense: measure 6 is a V42, which resolves to a I6, for a ii - V - I in G.  Then we get another little phrase, IV42 - ii7 - V7 - I, again in G.  Remember that the IV and ii chords form a ii-IV complex, where switching between them almost doesn't count as harmonic motion since the chords are basically the same anyway.</p>
<p class="text">There's one more little fact about this part of the progression, and it shows Bach's genius.  The way we split the progression, measures 5-7 are a ii - V - I, and measures 8-11 are another.  But measures 5-8 are in a sequence!  This sequence doesn't line up with the phrase if you interpret the phrase in G, but it does if you interpret it in C.  Look at that: measures 7 and 8 are directly copied from 5 and 6, just down a diatonic step (in G).  Measure 9 breaks the sequence in the upper voices, but not in the lower ones, because the second between the bass and tenor in measure 8 still needs to resolve to a third.</p>
<p class="text">Another important feature that happens here and in a few other places is the low D at measure 10.  In the first 8 measures, we've had 5 measures of C and 3 of B in the bass.  Measure 9 stretches this out just one more note, to A.  And then, at 10, we leap all the way down to D.  Bach could have just kept the A in the bass at 10 and used a second inversion chord for a smooth bass line, but he was presumably tired of smooth bass lines, giving us our first root position V - I of the piece.</p>
<p class="text">At 12, we can consider this little section in G to be over.  Measures 1-4 are the intro, then 5-11 are the next section in the dominant, but at 12 we have some new chords that we have to make sense of.  A Gdim7 chord, hm, what's it doing here?  In the key of G, this is a common-tone diminished 7th, but since it doesn't resolve to the tonic, it's really a viio43/V.  Except that... it resolves to the minor v?  No.  We must have modulated back to C.  This way, we can understand the chord in measure 12 as the viio43/ii, since... that's what it is.  The question, then, is where we modulated back.  This is a question without an answer, because we're only safely back to C at measure 15.  I hear measure 12 as a secondary chord in C, not in G, so I think the pivot should be measure 11, but I admit that my argument here is not ironclad.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 12-15, then, we have another sequence, this time viio43/ii - ii6 followed by the same thing down a step, viio43 - I6.  (Note that the viio43 is borrowed from minor.  You probably didn't even notice, because that's how normal and common this particular borrowing is.)  Then, measures 16-19, we have the exact same thing we had in 8-11, just down a fifth.  It's exactly the same.  So while the details at 12-15 differ from those in 5-8, in both of these cases we have a four-bar sequence followed by (or overlapping with) IV42 - ii7 - V7 - I, with that dramatic low note in the bass on the V7.  This repeating harmonic pattern serves as a kind of motif in this piece without a melody, providing unity as well as variety.  When you hear something you've heard before, it triggers recognition, which is <em>great</em> for enjoyment of the music.  When it's in a different but similar context, then you get both unity and variety, which is the best you can hope for — keep listeners engaged <em>and</em> interested!</p>
<p class="text">Then in 20-24, we have a little transitional section.  From the I at 19, it's easy to move to a V7/IV, and this is what Bach does to introduce new notes (the Bb) and go someplace different.  There's not much that's actually special about these five bars except that Bach moves to the subdominant in measures 20-21 but then he has to get back pretty quickly, so he uses descending dim7 chords at 22-23, and that last dim7 chord is kind of like a suspended V7.  It's a very short section of aimless wandering, really, but it helps make the music following this stand out that much more.</p>
<p class="text">Let's look more carefully at the chord in measure 22.  At 21, we have F F A C E; at 22, F# C A C Eb.  Where does the IV7 usually go?  V7, for a resolution.  The 4 goes up to 5 and the 3 goes down to 2.  Well, those are both whole steps, so what if we do them one half step at a time?  Then the 4 goes up to #4 and the 3 goes down to b3, making a viio7/V (which is borrowed, remember, since the key of the V would have viiø7 rather than viio7, but that's not important to anyone).  The 23 <em>would</em> be the ultimate resolution of that IV7, but Bach fakes the listener out by having the bass skip around the eventual target note, the G, by going to Ab first.  The F# - Ab - G form what's known as a <em>closure</em>, where you hit the notes around the target note before the target note itself.  The chord at measure 23 is also the only chord in the piece to have a passing tone!</p>
<h4 class="question">Why?  What if 23 is actually a iiø43, and the B is a lower neighbor to the C?</h4>
<p class="text">You could hear it that way, but then, look at the voice leading into the next measure.  The B jumps down to G.  Non-harmonic tones tend to resolve by step, not by leap.  The C, on the other hand, goes down to B.  Of course, the C is a dissonance regardless, since it's the seventh of the chord if it's harmonic, so it would have to resolve down, but the B's resolution only makes sense within the figure in measure 23, not across measures like the music is generally conceptualized.  Still, you hear it however you want to hear it!</p>
<p class="text">After that transition, we get to a kind of climax.  Since the bass is basically just going down, as are all of the other voices, it's not a high point, but it's a climax of the energy of the piece, because from 25-31 we have a dominant pedal.  There's also some repetition here: 25-27 get repeated almost verbatim in 29-31, with the only difference being the soprano E at 25 is a G at 29.  The pattern here is simple: I64 - V7(4) - V7(3).  It's a decorated V chord.  The I64 is a cadential 64, and it resolves to V7 like normal, except the 6 and 4 resolve separately, with the 6 first then the 4.  Obviously, I64 - V7(4) - V7(3) is pushing <em>so</em> hard to land on I, so at 28... DENIED!  viio7/V instead, still with the dominant pedal!  That viio7/V resolves to I64 - V7(4) - V7(3) again, which is now on try number two to get to I, so at 32, there it i— NOPE!  DENIED!  Bach is <em>such</em> a tease!  he lets you hear the first three notes of the chord before telling you that this is a V7/IV.  Sneaky bastard!</p>
<p class="text">But we did get all the way down to low C in the bass.  Now it's time for a tonic pedal.  The V7/IV resolves to IV64 at 33 (which would be a cadential 64 if it went to I, but it doesn't, so you should probably just think of it as a IV with a tonic pedal below it).  That IV64 goes on to a V7 at 34, this time definitely with a tonic pedal.  At these two measures, 33 and 34, the pattern breaks down, taking the voice leading down with it.  The changing pattern signals the end of the piece, and you'll notice that my recording slows down at that point as well.  Well, it continues to slow down.  I like slow.  Anyway, that IV does end with some D's, but only on the last beat, so I think it's fair to consider it a ii42, I don't think it's fair to do so until that last beat.  34 is a pretty standard and easy-to-read V7, though, and finally we get to the final I chord at the end.  This last chord has five voices, while the rest of the piece actually only has three (the alto, mezzo, and soprano all share one voice).  This thickening of the texture at the very end is something Bach <em>loves</em> to do, even in music with an otherwise strict number of parts, like a fugue.  In this case, though, it makes more sense, since there <em>are</em> effectively five voices throughout the piece, just not in measures 33 and 34!</p>
<p class="text">So, big picture, what did we get from this?  First, we're seeing the chords we just learned about in context.  Instead of seeing a thousand little bullshit examples that contain I - ii - V - I's contrived to include whatever chord I wanted to discuss at the moment, we're actually seeing <em>the</em> master composer, J. S. Bach, using these chords.  Second, we've learned that we can use the harmonic progression to identify the sections of a piece as well as harmonic motifs.  At first glance it may seem like the piece is just one long series of chords, one after the other, but really it has a bunch of points of interest: distinct sections, pedals, sequences, cadences, modulations, etc.  We can understand much of Bach's harmonic language by paying attention to the kinds of harmonic motion he uses, and otherwise opaque chords make more sense in context.</p>
<p class="text">Next, I'd actually recommend that you try your hand at some WTC preludes yourself.  Prelude 2 in C minor is very similar to Prelude 1, with a repeating pattern — a different repeating pattern, but still.  Prelude 3 in C# major is more melodic and less harmonically interesting; Prelude 4 in C# minor is slow and also melodic, but the chords are worth your time analyzing.  We've already seen Prelude 12, if you want to look at that again.  And, of course, you should read and play these on the piano if you can, while paying attention to the harmonic progression.  This kind of thing is invaluable when trying to understand a composer's style.</p>
<p class="text">Let's now jump forward the better part of a century to Beethoven.</p>
<h4 class="question">Skipping over the Classical period?</h4>
<p class="text">Yep.  Right over it.  Fart in Mozart's general direction on your way; you know he'd appreciate it.</p>
<h4 class="question">Ugh, fart jokes?</h4>
<p class="text"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozart_and_scatology">He started it</a>!</p>
<p class="text">Anyway, Beethoven wrote a whole bunch of piano sonatas — as did Mozart, but Beethoven's are better.  One in particular is absolutely beautiful: the famous Sonata Nº8 "Pathétique", whose second movement was what inspired me to start learning piano more seriously.  That's not the one we're going to analyze.  Instead, we're going to do the first movement of probably the most famous piano sonata of all time, Sonata Nº14 "Moonlight", labeled "Sonata quasi una Fantasia" by Beethoven.  The "Moonlight" name actually came from a music critic, Ludwig Rellstab, who wrote (after Beethoven had died) that the first movement sounded like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_Sonata_No._14_(Beethoven)">moonlight on a lake</a>, and the name stuck.  The actual instruction, "Sonata quasi una Fantasia", is open to interpretation, but a fantasia is a kind of free-form piece, so some think that it has something to do with the form of this sonata being different from the usual.</p>
<p class="text">See, a sonata is like a symphony, but for a solo instrument or small chamber ensemble.  In a symphony, you generally have a fast or moderate first movement in sonata form, a slow second movement, a third movement in some sort of triple time in minuet or scherzo form, and a fast fourth movement, often in rondo form (we'll talk about that eventually).  (Of course, plenty of symphonies deviate from this, including Beethoven's Symphony Nº6 "Pastoral")  A sonata is generally similar to a symphony minus the third movement: fast/moderate in sonata form, slow, fast.  The Moonlight Sonata, on the other hand, is basically movements 2, 3, and 4 of a symphony: slow, scherzo, fast.  It's the slow first movement that concerns us here; let's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Tr0otuiQuU">listen to it</a> (you're welcome to look for other recordings that interpret it in a way you like better):</p>

<? createExample('Moonlight I'); ?>

<h4 class="question">That sounds nice, but why does the tempo keep changing?  Why are the dynamics so weird?  What's that Italian thing at the start?  Are those triplets?</h4>
<p class="text">Whoa, one thing at a time!  The tempo keeps changing because that's how people play Romantic-era piano music.  I can't say whether Beethoven himself intended it to be played this way, but does it really matter?  What's important is that the performer thinks it sounds good.  Beethoven wrote "Adagio sostenuto", which basically means "really fucking slow" (despite the piece being in cut time for some reason), and people interpret that as they will.  The same goes for the dynamics.  The written dynamics are minimal, with the expectation that the performer will pour his heart and soul into the music rather than slavishly stick to what's written.  The crescendos and decrescendos aren't even given specific start and end dynamics, so it really conveys a feeling more than anything precise, and it's up to the performer to decide how to bring the music to life.</p>
<p class="text">The Italian means that the entire piece should be played extremely delicately, whatever that means — again, it's up to interpretation — and the pedal should not be used.</p>
<h4 class="question">You mean the soft pedal, right, not the damper pedal?  It sounds so much better and more mysterious with the pedal, and "senza sordini" I know means "without mutes" from <? sectionLinkShort('notation articulations'); ?>, so it's gotta be the soft pedal, right?</h4>
<p class="text">Interestingly enough... no.  Beethoven really meant the damper pedal.  Mind you, I still use it when <em>I</em> play this piece.  I think it sounds much better that way.  But Beethoven presumably had different ideas.  He also had different pianos from what we use today, so that might be part of it, I don't know.  As for the triplets, you should be able to realize that that's what they are without being told, given how they're beamed.  The edition I used has the 3's written in the first measure and "simile" in the second, indicating that triplets are meant throughout.  I would have left the 3's in, but when I started cross-staffing notes — meaning that I was sticking the top staff's notes on the bottom staff, like in measure 5 beat 1 — Sibelius started to do really weird stuff with the triplets, showing them as if the notes were still in the top staff, so I just took out the 3's.</p>
<p class="text">One other thing in the music that's nothing more than a basic interpretation suggestion is the slurs all over the place — those are phrase markings, really, not actual slurs, and I didn't feel like dealing with them, so I left them out.  I hope you don't mind!</p>
<p class="text">All right, let's talk about the music!  First, we're no longer in C major.  Woohoo!  Second, this is <em>not</em> a prelude, but it's similar enough to a prelude that I figured it makes sense to consider it one.  We have here a consistent texture: whole notes or half notes in the bass, arpeggio triplets in the alto, some minimal melody in the soprano that isn't even contrapuntally independent (we'll get to that).  This pattern continues throughout the piece, for the most part; there are several deviations and other interesting activities, but for the most part, this piece is made up of chords on a pattern, just like the Bach prelude we just looked at.  It <em>is</em> longer — there are twice as many measures, and it's much slower too — so it can actually have a form that's more fleshed out than the handful of phrases in the Bach prelude.  We'll be able to apply some of the sonata form here, but only some.  Bach and Mozart like to stick to formula (not to liken the greatest composer of all time with the likes of Mozart), but Beethoven is much more adventurous, and it shows in the harmonic choices. he makes.  Let's look at those.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 1-4 are an introduction.  Just like the Bach example, we have a sample self-contained phrase using the pattern, and it doesn't go anywhere, just back to i at 5.  Unlike Bach's, though, this progression is more than just a simple i - iiø - V - i: there's a descending bass line.  The first two chords, i - i42, establish that the arpeggios are in a sense meant to be constant throughout the piece, as the bass changes but the arpeggio does not.  This i42 goes to bVI, creating a change in feel with a major chord, and that goes to another major chord, the Neapolitan sixth.  We'll see that bII6 throughout the piece; it's one of the principal harmonic motifs.  The bII6 goes to V, as normal, and the V moves around a bit to reposition the chord.  Notice the voice leading: the F# in measure 3 goes to F# in measure 4; the A in measure 3 goes to G# in measure 4, and the D in measure 3 resolves down, as usual, to the B# in measure 4.  The problem is that Beethoven wants to start measure 5 with the arpeggio in position E G# C#, which means that the G B# F# needs to be rearranged.  He does this slowly, taking the F# down to D# first by means of the E, which introduces a suspended C# (which resolves), and finally, the G# goes down to F# to get ready for the E.  These may look like four different chords, but they're really all just part of the same V7 chord.  We'll look at this kind of thing more closely in a few sections.</p>
<p class="text">In measures 5-9 we have what passes for a first theme.  Notice how I'm breaking the phrases: the first phrase, 1-4 — actually, 1-5 — ends in a V - i cadence, and 5-9 does as well, but in the key of the relative major, the bIII, E.  We just have i - V65 - i in the tonic key, and then ii - V - I in the relative major (the V is actually I64 - V7, where the I64 is a cadential 64 that prolongs the dominant).  This modulation uses the iv = ii pivot, which is a common way to modulate from the minor to its relative major.</p>
<p class="text">This theme is very much worth exploring melodically, because it's incredibly effective given how minimalist it is.  It's made up of a simple motif: da ta-da.  Dotted eighth, sixteenth, dotted half.  The sixteenth note is in rhythmic conflict with the triplets below it, which gives it a kind of out-of-time-ness that creates tension.  Try to imagine (or actually play) this melody lining up with the triplets instead, and listen for the lack of pathos.  It's the sixteenth note rhythm that makes the moment magical instead of ordinary.  Beethoven isn't generally famous for his melodies — there are a few exceedingly beautiful melodic <em>moments</em> in this piece, for example, but overall the melody is not worth singing.  Instead, he is a genius of musical architecture using harmony and the barest possible melodic snippet (think of his famous Symphony Nº5, for example) to create impossibly beautiful musical worlds.</p>
<p class="text">The motif is also on the dominant, which means that the first time you hear it, it's the dominant chord, and the second time, it's the tonic.  You don't even need the other parts to know that.  Just one note, with that rhythm, tells you everything you need to know.  Beethoven did something similar with the second movement of his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHxmAsINDk">Symphony Nº7</a>, where a rhythmic motif on the dominant conveys a V - i progression by itself.  Beethoven isn't a minimalist composer, so there <em>are</em> chords being played, but he takes great advantage of this effect.</p>
<h4 class="question">How do you get a chord progression out of just one note?</h4>
<p class="text">It's simpler than you'd think.  Assume that you know which note is the tonic, so when you hear the dominant, you know that it's the dominant in reference to the tonic.  When you here "da ta-da", the first two notes are clearly a pickup into the third note, which is a resolution.  You're on the dominant and music generally starts on the tonic chord, so you can figure out that the chord during the pickup is meant to be a i (assume you know it's minor).  The resolution is going to be a change in chord otherwise the music is static.  What chords have a 5 other than the i?  There's the bVI7 (not bloody likely), the bIII, and the V.  i - bIII is not much of a progression, so clearly the chord is V.  Then the "da ta-da" happens again.  You know you're on the V already; where do you go from there?  Back to i, of course!</p>
<h4 class="question">But then how do you know the composer didn't mean something else?</h4>
<p class="text">You don't, and if the composer actually just plays the one note, the composer clearly intended you to hear whatever you want to hear in the music.  That said, Beethoven actually <em>has</em> the rest of the harmony here; it's just that the music would still make sense without it in the background.</p>
<p class="text">Continuing from the "da ta-da"s, we have some half notes ending in a cadence.  There's pretty much nothing remarkable about the melody itself, which it itself remarkable.  Beethoven gives us this incredibly poignant motif, but then he lets the melody fade back into the background.  Something I do want to point out, though, is the voice leading.  The bass line is doubled at the octave: this is <em>not</em> parallel octaves; it's just an octave doubling.  Pretty much all music for a large ensemble needs to double parts, at the unison or at the octave, and that doesn't count.  What <em>does</em> count is what's happening between the melody and the tenor, which are also in octaves for much of the piece.  We don't like parallel octaves in four-part writing because it eliminates the independence of the parts and sticks out, but here, Beethoven is essentially doubling the tenor up the octave for a few beats, until measure 8 beat 3.  The melody and tenor sometimes stay together and sometimes don't, so you can say that the lines are mostly not independent.  One good reason for the tenor and melody to mostly be an octave apart is for practical reasons: a piano player's hand can generally comfortably span an octave, but any more than that starts getting a bit dicey.  Some players have large hands and can do tenths with no problems; others with smaller hands have trouble.  The biggest right hand stretch in this piece is a ninth, one of which happens at measure 8 beat 4 between the tenor A and the melody B.  The left hand mostly has octaves the entire piece.  If the melody and tenor were more independent, there would be some very uncomfortable hand stretches here.</p>
<p class="text">Just to make it clear, Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier was written for keyboards technically, but it's relatively abstract music that could potentially be played on any instrument or instruments without damaging the piece (and the keyboard would have been a harpsichord, not a piano).  Beethoven's piano music, on the other hand, was specifically meant to be played on a nice-sounding piano, and Beethoven specifically employs the piano's properties to control the sound of the piece, including use of pedals.  Keyboards in Bach's time were often smaller as well, so the music never goes very low; Beethoven's music requires much more of the full 88 keys of the piano.  The keyboard I had at home when I started practicing was not a full keyboard, which meant that I had to give up on the lower octave.  Total pain.</p>
<p class="text">Anyway, the next phrase is 10-15.  Here, the harmony gets interesting.  We're in E major, but here's an E minor chord — what's goin on?  Modal shift to E minor?  Could be...  But the cadence at 15 is in B minor, and from 12 we can see a clear bII - V in B minor, so even though we don't know we're in B minor yet at measure 10, that's where our modulation is taking us.  I'm treating the chord in 10 as a i = iv pivot, but remember that the i is really borrowed, because we're in E major at this point.</p>
<h4 class="question">Yeah, but <em>are</em> we?</h4>
<p class="text">Good point.  It's unclear.  We <em>were</em> in E major at 9, but maybe we did a modal shift to E minor?  You can make your own choices when analyzing the piece.  I can see the merits of that view, especially since we go from E minor to G7.  This is done via The Motif, "da ta-da", now in G natural.  Again, "da ta-da" is accompanied by V7 - I, this time in C major, and again the bass goes down a step, like it does from 5 to 6, except that since the bass is on the 3 of C major, it goes down a whole step to the 2, for a V43 chord.  At 12, this little C major section resolves, only for the C to go down to A# (through the passing tone B in a iv64 passing 64), showing that the C major was actually a bII in B minor.  So you <em>could</em> actually put 10-12 in C major, but I feel like that's too short for a modulation when all that's really happening here is that we have a V43/bII - bII.  By the way, look at the alto in measure 12.  Beat 1 it has a C, beat 2 B, beat 3 C#.  The bass has beat 1 C, beat 2 B, beat 3 A#.  What's this?  <em>Parallel octaves</em>!  This time it's for real!  Of course, Beethoven was a master of counterpoint and voice leading; he did this on purpose because he thought it sounded better than the alternatives.  This is why the Neapolitan chord is usually in first inversion.  There was no way to avoid parallel octaves here without compromising <em>something</em>.</p>
<p class="text">Now, this little section from 10-13 ends on the i chord, but that i is a bit unexpected: we just came from a modulation and a bII chord, so our tonality is still a bit up in the air.  So we hammer the B minor in with another cadence at 14, i64 - V - i.  By the way, notice at 13 how the melody and tenor have G - E - F# while the bass has E - G - F#.  The melody and bass are doing a <em>voice exchange</em>, switching notes while the other voices (alto and soprano) stay constant.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 15-19 we have another <em>actual</em> melodic segment.  If the "da ta-da" was our first theme, this is our second.  There's even activity in the bass!  Excitement!  We start with another modal shift: we had the E major go to E minor at 10, and now the B minor goes to B major at 15.  The simplest explanation is that B major is the dominant of E minor, the next chord, but clearly we're not <em>resolving</em> there, going back to B just after.  B is still our tonic (especially given what happens when this theme recurs in the recap at the end).  So, it's best to interpret the B major as V/iv and the E minor as iv.  Or we can think of this as B phrygian dominant, given the C natural in measures 16 and 18.  As much as I like this interpretation, it's almost certainly not what Beethoven himself was thinking, so I think we have to table that explanation.  However, the C going down to A# then B is the same thing that happens in a Neapolitan chord, with the b2 going to the 7 then the 1.  You could even hear measure 16 as bII - viio7 - I over a tonic pedal.  The reason I don't is because the melody is just so damn <em>dissonant</em>!  I love it!  The melody is usually in octaves with the tenor, but the C here is a minor ninth — a dissonant as fuck minor ninth — above the tenor, for three whole beats, before it goes to A#, a dissonant major seventh above the tenor, and finally resolves at the octave at 17.  This dissonance is so damn cool that Beethoven does it twice, with exactly the same melody and harmony.  The action in the bass also makes this theme an early climax of the piece.  It's the only time so far that we've had really <em>any</em> dissonance.  The C and A# are changing tones around the B, forming a closure; they work perfectly well as non-harmonic tones.</p>
<p class="text">So energetic is this second theme — which is really saying something for a slow piece like this — that the next few measures, 19-23, are a denouement, a relaxation of the tension.  The overall pitch goes down, down, as the music heads towards the cadence.  The first thing that happens is the E#dim7 chord at 19, which has to somehow be put in context.  By its spelling, we can guess that it's the viio7 of F# minor, and that's exactly where the music is going, but the tonality stays hidden until we actually get there.  This means that we can reinterpret the V/IV at 19 as a IV, and with the viio65, which has a common tone with the previous chord, we get a new direction.  Aurally, we have no idea what's happening until measure 20, when we get an actual dominant 7th chord that tells us we're in F# minor.  Dominant 7ths are the main indicators of tonality in Common Practice music, which is why secondary dominants are such a big deal.  As the denouement continues, we get another Neapolitan chord at 21, but instead of going straight to V, it goes to a passing chord, viio7/V, before going to i64 then V (with a 4-3 suspension).  The interesting bit is that the b2 in the bII6 chord <em>doesn't</em> eventually go down to the 7; the chord changes position before that happens.  The Neapolitan chord is such an important harmonic material in this piece that Beethoven is able to find ways to play around with its behavior.</p>
<p class="text">At 23-28, we're back to the first theme, the "da ta-da" from 5-9, exactly the same way but up a fourth in F# minor instead of C# minor.  Well, exactly the same way for two bars, enough for the i - V65 - i, but then we quickly modulate back to C# minor for the development.  The B# at 25 tells us we're not in F# minor anymore.  The chord there is a viio65, which is a dominant-type chord, and it moves to V65, another dominant chord, by means of a passing 64.  Interestingly here, we were in F# minor, and now we're presumably back in C# minor, but our passing chord is still an F# minor chord and we haven't actually seen a C# minor yet.  This is how you make modulations subtle.  When it does arrive, it's clearly the high point of the melody, as well as being at the top of a crescendo.  On top of all that, the bass and melody are together rhythmically at 26 in a unique rhythm: instead of the half notes they have throughout the piece, here the bass and melody both have dotted half quarter, to really drive the tension towards that i chord, which quickly dissipates into the dominant at 28.</p>
<p class="text">At 27, there are those two pickup chords, viio64 and viio7/V, and they resolve to V7b9.  Effectively, the first chord is a viio7 without the seventh, and the third chord is also a viio7 but with the root (a viio7 is a V7b9 without the root).  The viio7/V is therefore the dominant of the V7b9, so the three chords are in a little i - V - i relationship, except they're all diminished chords.</p>
<p class="text">28-40 has a constant dominant pedal, characterizing this development section of the piece as unstable.  Let's take it one chunk at a time.</p>
<p class="text">Starting at 28, we get this V7b9 chord, which we'll be seeing a lot of.  There's a melody here, G# - A - F#, which repeats at 29 an octave lower.  What's interesting about this is that the bass in the second theme, at 16 and 18, has the same rhythm and contour.  At measure 30, the V7b9 resolves to i... oh wait, no it doesn't, because the dominant pedal makes it a i64.  We've got a long way to go!  Again, we get that same bass motif from the second theme, just with a different harmony.</p>
<p class="text">At 32, things actually get different.  From 32 to 37, we now use the arpeggios to climb up instead of simply staying at the same place.  The harmony is just V7b9 - i64, like before, but then there's a secondary dominant for variety, the viio7/V (with a dominant pedal), and that goes back to V7b9, which is held for three bars since the chord doesn't actually change; it just goes up and then all the way down.</p>
<p class="text">Measures 37-42 we finally resolve this development section.  The downward arpeggio is broken up a bit by the heavier notes at the end of 37, the D# and C# that go to B#, forming a little melody.  The C# isn't in the chord, so we can hear that as a passing iv64 (still over the dominant pedal, though).  Same thing at 38, but at 39, it's different: it's a D natural instead.  Neapolitan chord!  It's generally a good idea not to repeat something the same way too many times, which is why Beethoven changes it up here.  40 starts the same way, but then the pedal finally breaks for a little circle of fifths progression: bVI - iiø65 - V7 - i, for our first actual cadence to the tonic of the piece since measure 5 (measure 27 was in the middle of a phrase, so it's not a cadence).</p>
<p class="text">With that comes our recapitulation.  Measures 42-46 are just like measures 5-9, ending in a modulation to the relative major.  You'll recall that at 10 we went to the parallel minor chord of that key, Em, but here, we're staying in E major with a V - I in measures 47-48 under the "da ta-da" theme, this time on B instead of G natural, but in 48, we quickly modulate back to the tonic, C# minor.  At 49, we have the same thing we had at 26, except in rhythmic diminution: at 26, the V65 lasted a full measure, but here it's only a half note.  We then do a bII6 - V7 - i cadence into 51, again using the Neapolitan chord that's so essential to this piece.</p>
<p class="text">51-55 we now have the second theme again, exactly the same as in 15-19 except that was in B minor and this is in C# minor.  B minor, by the way, is <em>not</em> a related key to C# minor, since it has two fewer sharps and the related keys have at most one accidental of difference.  Beethoven was far more free in his modulations than, say, Bach.  Also, the second theme is <em>usually</em> in the dominant in the exposition but in the tonic in the recap.  Beethoven, liking to not play by the rules, puts it in the key of the bvii in the exposition, but he still goes back to the tonic for the recap, because that's kind of the point of the recap, to recontextualize things in the key of the tonic as a return home.  Since we know we're in the key of the tonic, this validates our V/iv - iv choices earlier, since these are the functions we observe in the tonic key.</p>
<p class="text">This second theme is a bit less exciting the second time around, since it's familiar and we know exactly where that dissonance is going, but it still needs a denouement.  From 55 to 57, we have a harmonic sequence of sorts.  It's not really a sequence because the figurations don't repeat, but the chords do move in a circle of fifths: V/iv - iv - V65/bIII - bIII - bVI65 - iio - V65 - I.  Actually, you know what, if we start counting from beat 3 of measure 56, it <em>is</em> a true sequence.  Root position diminished triads are fairly uncommon (less so as iio chords, but still), but in a sequence they make sense, and that's what's happening here.  This denouement ends in a cadence, much like at 23, to the tonic at 60, thus ending the recapitulation, much like 23 ended the exposition.</p>
<h4 class="question">We ended the recap?  But there's still music left, right?</h4>
<p class="text">Right!  At measure 60 begins the <em>coda</em>, the ending section after the two themes are recapitulated.  This is one of my favorite codas of all time: measure 60 is just like the beginning of the exposition at measure 5, except the melody is now two octaves lower, in what we're going to call the baritone, since there's still a bass hanging out below it.  The only thing this melody does is play that heavy and emotional "da ta-da" while the bass alternates between V and i until the end.  60 and 61 are just like 5 and 6, but at 62, the up and down arpeggio figurations from the development section come back.  This time there's a little extra voice in 63 beat 4 resolving to 64 and again from 65 to 66.  I think Beethoven wanted to put the tonic in the upper voice at 64 and 66, so he made the leading tone B# in the arpeggios into a quarter note and turned the A into a suspension.  You might think that he did it in order to avoid the augmented second between the A and the B# in the same voice, but he clearly doesn't care about that — see measure 35, for instance, as well as plenty of other spots in this piece where he has augmented seconds.  In an arpeggio, the notes aren't <em>really</em> all in the same voice because you have a compound melody, so even if melodic augmented seconds were an issue for him, which they aren't, that wouldn't be relevant here.  I think he also just likes the change in texture.</p>
<p class="text">The final ending comes at 66-69, where the harmonic motion stops and you just have a tonic chord while the arpeggios go down and down until they reach the bottom.  Beethoven loves to end pieces this way, and I can see why, because it sounds very nice.  The lack of harmonic motion helps create a feeling of stillness.  If you want to actually think about moonlight during this piece, as Rellstab did, this bit is when the moon sets or disappears behind a cloud or something or maybe the window closes, I don't know.  Some (like Liszt) see this first movement as a dark abyss, but the moonlight imagery is so much more fitting, isn't it?</p>
<p class="text">Just don't get too comfortable with that ending, because the next movement is attacca and it's a <em>really fucking peppy</em> scherzo in Db major.  Fucking whiplash, man.</p>
<h4 class="question">Attacca?</h4>
<p class="text">It means to go to the next movement with no break.  I don't know why Beethoven would do such a thing, but he does love his attacca transitions.  Then the third movement is... much harder to play than the first two, that's for sure.  It's very fast, back in C# minor, and it's a fantastically fun piece to listen to.  You should go listen to it if you aren't familiar.  We're not going to analyze it now, but it's <em>awesome</em>.</p>
<p class="text">Overall, what did we learn from this analysis?  A few things, I think.  One is the centrality of the V - i (or V - I) <em>cadence</em>, where the music actually reaches a resting point.  Beethoven has them fairly frequently, and they delineate the sections of the music.  Two is how much Beethoven loves Neapolitan chords.  We didn't see a single one in the Bach prelude (Bach in general doesn't use them much), but this movement is basically built on it.  The bII chord provides an unexpected major sound, and in this piece, in which Beethoven plays with chord color so much, the Neapolitan sound is an invaluable color in the palette.  Three is the amount of <em>magic</em> you can get by just playing one note with the right rhythm.  Here's a fun exercise: try coming up with three more big-picture things you've learned from this analysis.  Then do it again.  There are 69 measures' worth of important general insights, I'm sure.</p>
<p class="text">One more prelude awaits, this one by Chopin.  Chopin also wrote a cycle of 24 preludes, one in each major and minor key, but this time there are no fugues, and instead of going up chromatically, he went around the circle of fifths.  The first prelude is in C major, the next in A minor, then G major, E minor, D major, B minor, etc.  The one we're going to look at is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef-4Bv5Ng0w">Prelude Nº4 in Em</a>, an <em>incredibly</em> famous piece that's also quite easy to play.</p>
<h4 class="question">My God, that was like pulling teeth.</h4>
<p class="text">You're welcome to try to find a better recording.  Everyone and their mother (I know, the plural is off) has recorded this piece.  My synthesized recording might be better, though?  Try it:</p>

<? createExample('Chopin Prelude 4'); ?>

<h4 class="question">That was sort of better, but the tempos were still weird.</h4>
<p class="text">Yeah, you really get diminishing returns trying to get the tempos just right in Sibelius, so at some point I kind of just decided it was good enough.  Luckily, this piece is easy enough to play that you can make your own better recording if you so choose.</p>
<p class="text">I did have to change a couple of things, by the way, from my edition (you can find this on IMSLP if you care), both in measure 16.  First, the 32nd note triplets are not written in in the original; there's just a turn ornament there with an x below it.  Sibelius doesn't play back accidentals in turns, so I figured I'd just write it out instead (notice the cool cross relation between the Gx and the G natural).  The other thing is that the "stretto" written above that measure has a dashed line until the end of the next measure, but Sibelius doesn't have a symbol for stretto with a dashed line, so I used an accel and hid it.  This is why the tempo gets faster right there; remember that stretto in this sense means to tighten the pace, and smorz. at 21, short for "smorzando", means to slow down and get softer.  Also, Sibelius is pretty crappy at playing back the pedal markings, so maybe you should try to find a version played on a real piano.  Just saying.</p>
<p class="text">This very famous prelude is quite short, and unlike the other two we've just heard, it doesn't really focus on a pattern, exactly — as far as there's a pattern, it's just constant eighth note chords.  There <em>is</em> a melody, and it's an incredibly important melody even though it's very simple: it starts on B and slowly, very slowly, with detours and a false start, goes down to E.  A prelude is generally built around a single idea, and the idea for this prelude is the melodic double arc over repeated eighth note chords.  These chords are almost all in three voices, which makes the whole thing a four-voice texture (except for the few moments when it isn't, but we'll get to them).</p>
<p class="text">The reason I chose this prelude to analyze should be fairly obvious: it's all chord-based.  There are a few moments of melodic action, but otherwise the only thing that's really going on is chords.  And they're <em>hard</em> chords to analyze!  Beethoven's whole thing was bII - V - i's, but in <em>this</em> piece, there is <em>one</em> i: the very last chord.  Chopin spends the entire piece avoiding it.  The melody, which starts on B and heads down to E, actually fails in the first half of the piece, getting to a V7 chord at 12 but ending up right back on the B, ready to try again, with the E completely avoided except for one eighth note at 9.  Second time there's more drama and one eighth note triplet E at 18 (similar to the one at 9), but the music <em>does</em> finally arrive at the E at 21 (with an anticipation).  Except that the chord's wrong; it's not the tonic.  It takes several more measures to <em>finally</em> get to the tonic at 25, and then we can feel at rest and breathe.</p>
<p class="text">Let's begin to carefully analyze the harmony.  The first four bars are a unit of sorts, where the melody stays on the B the entire time, forming almost a dominant pedal.  The C, a neighbor tone, decorates the B, and since it's a half step away, there's a lot of potential for dissonance.  Four bars makes sense here too; remember the "da ta-da" from the first theme of the Moonlight, which on its own signifies a V - i?  The four bars of B alternating with C do something similar here.  Four is a particularly common number of bars for a phrase, so the first B (plus the pickup) asks a question, then the C - B into measure 2 answers it, but it's not settled yet; C - B into bar 3 asks the second question, and the C - B into bar 4 answers that.</p>
<h4 class="question">That's kind of a lot of information from two repeated notes, no?</h4>
<p class="text">It is, but it's supported by the harmony.  The harmony simply goes down, though much faster than the melody, which hasn't moved after four bars.  The goal of the harmony is the V7/iv in bar 4, which, if this weren't Chopin, would resolve to a iv (or iv6) in bar 5 when the melody finally gets to the 4.  The reality is much more complicated.  From the start, we have a i6, <em>not</em> a i, because Chopin is saving that root position tonic.  The i6 then goes to V, which is what you'd expect, but since Chopin wants a chromatic descending bass line, it's a V43 — a <em>suspended</em> V43, with a 4th.  Let's try to understand the symbol here.  The chord is a B7 chord with a suspended fourth (in a 4-3 suspension), which is the E, except in it's in second inversion.  A second-inversion B7 (in the key of Em) is V43, and the suspended fourth is actually a seventh above the bass, so we can call it V743.  Note that the symbol could be ambiguous, but since we're looking at the sheet music, we can easily see what is meant.  The suspension resolves in beat 3, so we just have a regular V43, but since the suspension resolves, we want to specifically note that, hence the full symbol V643.</p>
<h4 class="question">Um, the 6 would be the D#, but this is an Eb.  It's a b7 or bb7 or something.</h4>
<p class="text">You're right, but at this point in the music, you can't tell.  I don't know why Chopin decided to call it an Eb instead of a D#, but really it's the D#.  The chord here is F# A D# with the B in the melody, making it a B7 chord in second inversion; it's just a bit disguised.  The Eb <em>would</em> make sense if we interpret beat 4 as an F#dim7 chord, but I don't see a functional point in calling it that, since it's really still behaving like a dominant.</p>
<p class="text">The bass drops another half step in measure 3, so now we have an F7 chord, and the Eb kind of makes sense there too, especially since it resolves down to the D.  But don't forget the B in the melody, which makes this more like a FrV43 chord, an altered V43 with a lowered fifth (the bass).  However, we have another interpretation here: this is actually a Fr43/V/iv, a secondary aug6 chord.  Recall that an aug6 chord resolves to the dominant, so the Fr43 resolves to the V.  Secondary aug6 chords are tricky to notate: is the Fr43/V/iv the Fr43 in the key of the V/iv?  The convention we're using in this book is that the Fr43 <em>resolves to</em> the V/iv, so the default Fr43 is actually Fr43/V, and the FrV43 is actually Fr43/i.  Since i and V/iv have the same root, they have the same aug6 chord leading to them.</p>
<p class="text">The reason why this chord has this dual interpretation is because it appears as a continuation of the V chord from the previous bar, so it makes sense to hear it as an alteration of that chord, but it does eventually resolve to the V7/iv in the next bar.  However, it's clear that Chopin wasn't thinking in terms of augmented 6th chords, because this piece doesn't actually <em>have</em> any augmented sixths (unless I missed one somewhere, but I don't think so).  Instead, you just see dominant 7ths that function as aug6's.</p>
<p class="text">The misspelled — sorry, <em>differently-spelled</em>, let's be politically correct here — augmented 6th in measure 3 goes down to the regular 6th, which, to be fair, explains why it was misspelled — ahem, <em>differently-spelled</em> — in the first place.  This is now a D minor chord, the iv6/iv, as part of a run-up to the iv chord we're expecting at 5.  iv6 goes before V, so iv6/iv is appropriate before V/iv.  Except, of course, for the B still sounding in the melody, so I called it iiø43/iv, which is pretty much the same thing, really.  The next chord is a bit tougher, because it's F G# C D, enharmonically a Dø7 in first inversion.  I analyzed the C as non-harmonic, making this chord actually F G# B D, a G#dim7 in third inversion, also known as viio42/iv.  This chord is very similar to the V7/iv, with just one semitone of difference in one voice (the F needs to go to E), so I consider it an anticipation of the true V7/iv.  In measure 3, then, we have two pre-dominants in the key of the iv, the Fr43/V/iv and the iiø43/iv, and they resolve to V7/iv in measure 4 by means of an anticipation, viio42/iv.  In all of this, the bass continues to descend by a half step each measure, and that directionality helps us expect that it will indeed reach E at measure 4 to prepare for the arrival of the 4 of the scale, A, at measure 5.</p>
<p class="text">In measure 4 itself, though, we have a bit of a problem.  The chord at the downbeat is E G# D B, a nice E7 chord, the V/iv.  We want to resolve that to some sort of Am chord, the iv, whose notes are A C E, using the simplest possible chromatic motions.  Actually going down to a root position Am chord is out of the question, because that's way too far for the bass, so we have to settle for second inversion, and if we're going to do that, might as well make it a less awkward 7th chord, so our new target is iv43, notes E G C A.  The B goes down to the A via Bb, the E in the bass stays, the G# in the tenor goes down to G, and the D goes down to the C via the C#.  Now that we know where each voice is going, let's see how that happens.  Beat 1 of measure 4, we have E G# D B.  This is a fairly important chord, so it lasts two beats.  Beat 3, the G# moves down to G, one move done.  The other two moves require two chromatic steps, so on beat 4, the melody B goes down to Bb and the alto D goes down to C#.  Then, on beat 1 of bar 5, the Bb finally goes to A and the C# finally goes to C.  We took a fairly simple V7 - i43 resolution and dragged it out over an entire bar.  Pretty clever, eh?</p>
<p class="text">This also makes the chords not actually functional.  Beat 3 can be analyzed as a i7 chord, which is fine, but it's really a repositioning of the V7/iv.  Beat 4 was difficult to figure out, though.  It's clearly spelled as a C#dim7, but what function does this chord have in, really, any key?  Is it a viio7/V?  No, there's no V in sight.  But the iv43 does share two notes with the i chord, the E and G, so since our previous chord was a i7 and the downbeat of bar 5 is a reasonable substitute for a i chord, we can call the chord on beat 4 a common-tone diminished chord.  It resolves irregularly, but it would in minor anyway, since the chord in major generally has a #2 that resolves to 3, but in minor it's a b3.</p>
<p class="text">In measure 5 we finally have our arrival on A with this iv43 chord.  Our next goal is going to be four measures later, which we would assume is a G over a i chord of some sort, which four bars later should get to an F# with a V chord, and four bars after that to E with a i chord.  Of course, that's not what happens <em>at all</em>.  What do you think this is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cr2phuktKGU">bossa nova</a>?</p>
<h4 class="question">Nice, Tom Jobim's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o5OaRM4YWw">Insensatez</a>.  Great piece.</h4>
<p class="text">I know, right?  It's so similar to this prelude!  Insensatez does have more regular four-bar phrases, it has a bossa nova feel, and it doesn't do the fakeout of starting over after three of them like Chopin.  But the chromatically descending chords are still there.  Was Chopin writing bossa nova?</p>
<h4 class="question">...Yes.</h4>
<p class="text">I'm cool with that.</p>
<p class="text">Anyway, measure 5.  Let's keep in mind the goal of eventually reaching i at measure 9.  The chord that comes before i is V, so we should head there first.  In measure 5 beat 3, Chopin takes a step there by going to iiø42 (assuming the B on beat 4 is non-harmonic), which just involves dropping the G to F#, since iv chords and iiø chords are naturally very similar (remember, they form the ii-IV complex, or iiø-iv in minor).  A funny thing happens at measure 6, though: the bass note suddenly becomes non-harmonic!</p>
<h4 class="question">How?  Literally nothing changes between beat 3 of measure 5 and beat 1 of measure 6!</h4>
<p class="text">That's not true!  One thing changes: the measure.  You <em>expect</em> a change in chord at the downbeat.  Every measure so far has had one.  So the lack of change at the downbeat of 6 tells us that there's a suspension, and the one note that's a candidate for this suspension is the 7th of the chord, the bass note, which is dissonant with the note a second above it.  That suspension resolves on beat 3 of bar 6 to the D#, finally giving us our dominant, a viio7.  After this, of course, we should get a real dominant, with the C going down to B to make a first-inversion B7.</p>
<h4 class="question">But that's not what happens.</h4>
<p class="text">Nope!  Tricksy Freddy Chopin!  We get a dominant 7th all right — THE WRONG ONE!  The D# goes further down to D, and measure 7, the whole of it, is dedicated to this one D7 chord.  Notice that a dominant 7th is just one semitone away from a diminished 7th; V7 is spelled 5 7 2 4, while viio42 is spelled b6 7 2 4.  Since the dim7 chord is symmetric, lowering any note will get a dominant 7th.  From this one, D# F# A C, we can lower the D# to get D7, lower the F# to get F7, lower the A to get Ab7, or lower the C to get B7.  There's a reason not to lower the C, though: it would create parallel sevenths, which sound awkward.  Instead, Chopin opted for a shift to the relative major, so the goal of getting to the G over a i chord would actually be with a bIII chord instead.</p>
<h4 class="question">But that's not what happens.</h4>
<p class="text">Nope!  Tricksy Freddy Chopin again!  We get a little cadence to the iv — iv6, actually.  If we were in C major, the chords in measure 8 would appear to be ii7 - viiø65 - viio65, which would resolve to I in measure 8.  And that's <em>pretty much</em> what happens, but we actually resolve to A minor in first inversion instead — very similar chord — so it makes a bit more sense (in my opinion) to consider these chords in the key of Am instead, the iv, where the cadence still makes sense: we have iv7 - iiø65 - viio43 - i6 in the key of the iv, again from slow non-coordinated downward chromatic motion.  The only little exception in this progression is barely worth analyzing, but it's the downbeat of 9.  The melody G# is tied over, so it's a retardation, and the B in the alto is suspended.  Both resolve to A on beat 2 of bar 9, but the sonority that does happen on that downbeat is bIII+7 in the key of the iv, so I marked it as such.</p>
<p class="text">In measure 9, we have... MELODY!  Finally!  This melody isn't actually <em>going</em> anywhere, but we'll see it come back two more times during the piece.  What the melody does is create some impetus towards that F# at 10, because from the logic of the rest of the melody, we should be hanging out at G right about now, not F#.  This little lick transitions us over that G, which Chopin presumably wants to avoid because it's too closely tied to the tonic triad that he's avoiding the fuck out of.</p>
<p class="text">Measure 10, then, we get to the F#.  We're so close to the E; we can smell it now!</p>
<h4 class="question">Oh, is that what that nasty smell is?</h4>
<p class="text">Oy.  I'm not even going to touch that.  No way!</p>
<p class="text">Here at 10-12, we just have V7 alternating with iv6.  Actually, since we start with a iv6 at 9, what's really going on is iv6 - V7, a few times, which we would expect to go to i.  There's even a little suspended bit at 10, which is just a 4-3 suspension, hardly worth bringing up.  While V7 - iv6 is considered a "backwards" progression — a <em>retrogression</em> — and is generally avoided in early Common Practice music, this situation is different, because the V7 isn't <em>resolving</em> to iv6; rather, the iv6 - V7 motion is just repeated a few times.  iv6 - V, incidentally, is known as the <em>phrygian half-cadence</em>, and that's what happens at 12, our first cadence of the piece.  Since it's to the dominant, it's a half-cadence, setting us up to start the whole thing again from the top.  This is also the first time that the left hand stops or does anything other than slowly descending eighth notes.  The melody bridges the gap with a little riff that specifically avoids hitting an E, the target note of this whole piece; the D# that would go to E instead way overshoots and ends up at the D natural, which goes back down to B to start over.  The D# and D natural would make this one of those V7 chords with both thirds, but I chose to just consider the melody notes non-harmonic.  You can go either way on that.</p>
<p class="text">At 13, everything starts again, with measure 13 exactly like measure 1, and measure 14 like measure 2... for the first half.  On beat 3, you'd expect the E to resolve down to the missp — er, <em>differently-spelled</em> Eb, which it does, but the F# goes down to F at the same time, reaching the chord from measure 3 two beats early.  Everything else is also shifted two beats: the viio42/iv and V7/iv and i7 and cto42 (now viio43/V, but it's the same chord) are also shifted back two beats compared to twelve bars earlier.  The weird thing is at the downbeat of 15: instead of the iiø43/iv, which we got in measure 3 from the Eb going down to D and then the A going down to G#, these two motions are reversed at 15; the A goes down to Ab first and then the Eb goes down to D.  This creates an interesting sonority that we haven't explored, the FrV4b3.  This is enharmonically a biiø7 chord, but that makes no functional sense.  A famous example of a Fr4b3 (not a FrV, since it goes to V rather than I) is the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tristan_chord">Tristan chord</a>, which we saw back in <? sectionLinkShort('other chords'); ?>.  It's a little worse than that, though, because that b3 should actually be a #2, making the chord a F G# B D# that resolves to E G# B E (or E G# B D in this case, on beat 3).  We don't have a convenient name and symbol for this chord!  Since it's functioning like a FrV43 (or rather Fr43/V/iv depending on whether you look at where it's coming from or where it's going), it makes sense to talk about lowering the third, but remember that even though Chopin wrote an Ab, the "right" note here is G#.</p>
<p class="text">Things get interesting at 16.  If we look at the melody of the piece, it starts out very regular, just dotted half notes and a neighbor tone, for four bars, then it goes down a step and continues that way.  It's only all the way in measure 9 that something different happens: there's a burst of melodic action as the melody fumbles its way over the G to the F#, and then it's back to the regularity at 10.  At 12, we get another burst of melody to head into the repetition, but the stillness of the repetition doesn't even last four bars, because at 16, the melody <em>explodes</em>.  You might look at the overall contour of the melody and figure that the piece's climax is right before the resolution, since the entire piece is heading downwards and reaching that goal should be climactic.  But you'd be wrong.  The climax is at 17.  Let's take a careful look.</p>
<p class="text">At 16, the first two beats are the last two beats of 4, which you'll recall have all been moved back two beats.  Same i7 and... the other chord, except the other chord is now viio43/V instead of cto42.</p>
<h4 class="question">Is it a different chord?  I don't understand.  It's the same notes.</h4>
<p class="text">Technically, a cto7 is a dim7 on the #2 and a viio7/V is a dim7 on the #4, but they're enharmonically (and, for most intents and purposes, actually) the same chord.  The difference is that cto7's tendency is towards I, while viio7/V's tendency is towards V.  In measure 4, the cto7 goes to... not i, but a i substitute, with two notes in common.  It has no tendency towards V whatsoever at this point.  The chord at 16, the viio43/V chord does go to V at the downbeat of 17 (with some passing chords along the way, but whatever).  Actually, first the viio43/V changes position to viio65/V; same chord, same notes, different inversion.  The next chord is a passing chord towards the ultimate goal.</p>
<h4 class="question">The iiø43?  I only see a iv6 there.</h4>
<p class="text">I'm counting the F# in the melody as harmonic and the E as an anticipation.  You could go the other way, if you wanted, and hear the F# as an appoggiatura and the E as harmonic.  Either way, it doesn't make a big difference, because either chord is simply another pre-dominant on the way to the big ol' V at 17.  In preparation for this arrival, the melody jumps up an octave: the melody <em>should</em> go B - Bb - A, but since we're expanding the diminished chord on the Bb, now actually an A#, we're going B - A# - G - E.  That G is an octave higher than you'd expect from a downward-moving line.  Switching octaves like that is known as <em>octave displacement</em>, and it's a common way to vary a melody.  Also, there's a cool cross relation here that you rarely see.  The A# is ornamented by a turn (which is written as an actual turn symbol in the music), which means playing its upper and lower neighbors.  The lower neighbor of A#, in this case, is Gx.  The very next note after the A#, though, is a G natural, so you have a Gx followed by a G natural an octave higher!</p>
<h4 class="question">I thought a cross relation was when a note changed accidentals in different parts.  This is all in the same melody, isn't it?</h4>
<p class="text">Yes, but since the melody jumps, it's not heard as a continuous line.  The actual reason to avoid cross relations in smooth voice leading is because a chromatic shift is smooth within one voice but not so much when the chromatic shift happens between notes of different octaves.  It's different octaves here.  That said, I don't hear it as a cross relation because the Gx and G natural are too unrelated.  It's just cool that it's in the music.</p>
<p class="text">17 is the big climax.  You can tell because all of a sudden there's a huge bass B in octaves, totally unlike all of the other stuff that's happened in the bass so far.  In addition, the harmonic rhythm speeds up in measure 16.  For the most part, there's just one or two chords per measure, but in 16, there are four, and they're <em>dissonant</em> and thirsting for that V.  After the low B, we go into a heavier five-part texture, where the left hand is now playing four notes instead of three, but looking at the pedal, we know that the B should still be sounding under it all.  Taking all these notes into account, our chord is a V7b9, and the melody E at the downbeat is just an appoggiatura.  That E to D# appoggiatura flips on beat 3, where now the D# is a retardation up to the E, on another tonic chord — a i6, but still.  When the retardation actually happens, we have a transitional chord between the five-part V7b9: the bIII+7.  I consider this chord just an appoggiatura chord, since it lasts for just the one eighth note; it resolves like a i#7 does, up to i.  Here, the bIII+7 is voiced b3 5 7 2, and the b3 and 5 stay for the i6 and the 7 and 2 both go to 1.  With that i6 we have a little bit of repose, but it's at the weak part of the measure and it's not in root position, so we know we still have more to go.</p>
<p class="text">At 18, our melody that had reached its high point needs to come back down, much like in measure 9.  The notes are actually almost the same: measure 9 has B D C E A F#, and measure 18 has the same but with an extra E an octave up.  This makes sense given the melody's peaks.  First we have the G at 16, but the real peak is the C at 17.  The next peak is the G, and then the E.  The idea here is to have the peaks not descend too fast, which would be unsatisfying.  The harmony during this descent is in stark contrast to the chromatic weirdness and loud dissonance we just had, but the B in the bass on beat 3 of 18 is prepared by the low A on beat 2, which is an echo of the low B at 17.</p>
<p class="text">We reach the F# at 18 halfway through the bar, unlike at 10, so in order to get lined up again, measure 10 is compressed into two beats at the end of 18.  Instead of a dotted half note and a quarter in the melody, it's dotted quarter eighth.  The harmony goes from the suspended V chord (not V7, probably to foreshadow the second to last chord, but who knows) straight to the iv6 without resolving the suspension.  Measure 19 then echoes that second half of 18 but expanded to a full measure, so the one beat of suspended V and one beat of iv6 become two beats of each, respectively.</p>
<p class="text">The resolution of that suspended V chord has to wait until measure 20, where you get two more motions to set up the big arrival on the tonic at 21: the 4-3 resolution happens on beat 3, and then you get that seventh on beat 4.  And just to really make us wait, Chopin anticipates the arrival of the E not as a quarter note like most of the piece, not as an eighth note lined up with the chords, but as a sixteenth note, just like Beethoven in Moonlight Sonata wanted to make us wait.  But finally, at 21, we can arrive on the tonic!</p>
<h4 class="question">But that's not what happens.</h4>
<p class="text">It isn't!  You were deceived!  The V7 goes to bVI instead — it's a deceptive cadence, where you think it's going to be V - i because all the signs are there, but nope, denied!  There is a cool thing that happens here, though: the bVIdom7.  This is an altered chord; it's not a secondary dominant or an augmented sixth.  It works just like any non-dominant 7th chord, except this one happens to be a dominant 7th.  In a V7, the 7 tends to go to 1 while the 4 tends to go to 3, resolving the tritone and the seventh.  Here, only the seventh needs to resolve, and while the root motion is along the diatonic circle of fifths — it goes from b6 to 2, which is a tritone, not a fifth — the bVIdom7 is not acting anything like the dominant of that iiø43 that follows it.</p>
<p class="text">The tonic finally arrives at 22, but kind of in a weird way.  It's suspended, with the A, and the A resolves back down to G... passing by the G# on the way.  You therefore get this surprise major chord along the way that's not a V/iv or anything; it's just a passing I64.  (By the way, note that the suspended chord on beat 1 the i74, is identical to the one in measure 10 other than the melody F#, and that's a V74.  Just saying.)  Speaking of which we've arrived at the i, but it doesn't feel like an arrival because we're in second inversion.  It's actually <em>not</em> a cadential 64 but a <em>passing</em> 64.  If you look at the bass, you can see it: at 21, the bass is C; at 22, B; at 23, Bb.  Taking a broader view, clearly B is the main point of the bass, with the C and Bb as neighbor tones (and the Bb should probably have been an A#).  At 23, we <em>actually</em> have an augmented 6th chord (yes, it's... differently-spelled).  This broader view would suggest that the chord at 21 is actually an It6 and not a bVIdom7 like how I analyzed it.  I think this is certainly an interesting connection but ultimately the ear doesn't remember what happened two measures ago that well at such a slow tempo, so I'd rather not analyze it that way, especially since more normal stuff happens in between.</p>
<p class="text">Then at 24, we <em>finally</em> get our cadence.  The E's, at 21, 22, and 23, have not been right; the melody had been trying to get to the E this whole time, but once it got there, the chord was wrong.  Here, at the very end of the piece, we make it right.  The melody signs us off with E - D# - E while the bass goes lower than at any other point in the piece with its V(4-3) - I.  Two root position chords, very resonant, suspended and resolved and resolved for real.  The entire piece we've wanted this, and now we finally have it.  Do we feel satisfied?  Are we full?  Are we hungry for more?</p>
<p class="text">This last chord is an <em>ending</em>, a very definitive one.  If we look at the entire emotional arc of the piece, we start with fairly low energy, which slowly ebbs and flows as the piece progresses.  Repeating the B heightens the tension, as does changing chords without resolving them.  That tension releases a bit at 5, which is a resolution to the repeated B's as well as the harmony, but the tension comes right back up with more repetition.  At 9, the music starts getting more active, reaching a mini-climax at 12.  Since the music repeats like the beginning, the tension builds again, since you generally expect a second phrase that begins like the first to intensify in order to resolve the lingering questions of the first phrase.  That it does; the differences come quickly, and the faster harmonic rhythm at 15 starts building to a true climax, which comes at the extremes of both the bass and the melody at 17.  After that, we have a slow release of the tension built in this climax, which still hasn't resolved harmonically, but it builds a bit until the melody finally resolves at 21.  The harmony still has a ways to go, building more tension.  The bass goes C, B, Bb, overshooting the B, but at 24, the rhythm slows down completely, the bass goes to the 5, the melody has a suspension with a clear direction of release, and we finally reach total repose at 25.  At this point, there is nowhere left to go, nothing left to resolve.</p>
<p class="text">The Bach prelude, on the other hand, does not have this kind of arc.  Instead, the prelude is heard in fairly short four-chord phrases, each with a cadence or something like it.  However, just like Chopin, when he finally arrives on the 1 — this time the low C in the bass — the resolution is deceptive in some way.  Here, measure 21 features a bVI, a true deceptive cadence.  In the Bach, the arrival at 32 is on a V7/IV, another substitute for the tonic chord.  In both cases, the music continues for a bit on a tonic pedal as the harmony finally settles on a cadence, the Bach in the bass and the Chopin in the melody.  Beethoven doesn't do this.  The last four bars of the first movement of the Moonlight consist of nothing other than i chords.  However, while Bach and Chopin delay the resolution of the <em>harmonic</em> tension, Beethoven delays the repose of the <em>rhythm</em>.  The coda, beginning at 60, dissipates the harmonic tension by simply repeating V - i, and the rhythmic tension is dissipated by running the triplets down into the bass register.</p>
<p class="text">I think it's instructive to consider what else these three pieces we've looked at have in common and what their differences are.  You should probably spend some time doing that now.  Obviously, they're three different pieces.  I called them all preludes, but Beethoven's piece is clearly a sonata movement with multiple themes, while Bach's prelude centered around a single idea and Chopin's had a bit more than that but was still generally just one arc.  However, I didn't give you a particularly wide experience in preludes.  The Well-Tempered Clavier Book I has 23 other preludes (and Book II has 24 more), and Chopin has 23 more in his collection as well.  Many other composers have written great preludes, some fast and some slow, some more melodic and some more harmonic.</p>
<p class="text">Speaking of harmony, we got to experience three different approaches to harmony.  Bach, ever the traditionalist, uses mostly the basic tonal chords with modulations when necessary, and his prelude is separated by the various ii - V - I cadences.  Beethoven takes a more imaginative approach to roughly the same thing: stuff happens, then ii - V - I, except we're in minor and Beethoven decided that every other chord should be a Neapolitan, so it's bII - V - i.  Chopin, on the other hand, uses in this prelude a <em>completely</em> different harmonic language, based on the same iio - V - i but where everything is chromatic.  Chopin doesn't need to modulate in this piece to get harmonic variety, but instead, he alters chords and moves chord members by semitones to achieve a single functional resolution over several chords.</p>
<p class="text">We could spend all day further dissecting these three pieces.  There's more in this chapter that we could apply to them, and we'll refer back to them from time to time.  However, I'll let you do that yourself.</p>
<h4 class="question">You're leaving it as an exercise to the reader?</h4>
<p class="text">Indeed.  It looks like you could use the exercise.</p>
<h4 class="question">...HEY!  I resemble that remark!</h4>
<p class="text">What we should do, then, is move on to the third of three sections on functional analysis, this time for extended tonality.  GET HYPE!</p>

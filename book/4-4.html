<p class="text">The <em>circle of fifths</em>, also known as the <em>cycle of fifths</em> or <em>circle/cycle of fourths</em>, is nothing more than the notes of the chromatic scale arranged by perfect fifths (or fourths if you go in the other direction).  Looks like this playable diagram:</p>

<p class="text">The actual circle of fifths is in the light gray ring.  In the outer ring I list the key signature for the major key on that tonic, and in the inner dark gray ring I list the relative minor (the small 'm' means "minor").  Should be self-explanatory, really.  You can click on the light gray or dark gray keys to play notes, or use the top row of your qwertyuiop[] keyboard.</p>
<h4 class="question">OK.  ...OK.  ...Whoa.  Whoa.  These notes.  I can't tell what octave they're in.  This is freaky!</h4>
<p class="text">Yeah, what octave <em>should</em> they be in?  I don't think it matters.  So I made them <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepard_tone">Shepard tones</a>.  This is a really cool idea that I saw at the Museum of Science in Ft. Lauderdale as a kid.  The way it works is that each note is played in a whole bunch of octaves at the same time, but the lower and upper octaves are very soft while the middle octaves are normal.  As the notes go up the scale, the lower octaves fade in and the upper octaves fade out, so you're never quite sure what the lowest or highest pitch is.  This means that if you just play these notes up the scale, you can keep going up and up and up and up indefinitely while never actually getting any higher, kind of like how the stripe on a barber pole keeps moving to the side but it never actually leaves the pole.  And if you play notes a tritone apart (on diametrically opposite sides of the circle of fifths) you may run into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tritone_paradox">tritone paradox</a>, which is insane.</p>
<p class="text">Try playing some tunes on the Circle of Fifths Keyboard.  It's a little weird since the notes that should be close to each other aren't (though wait until you play with the Tonnetz later on), but notice how you can kind of will the notes to go up or down depending on the tune.</p>
<h4 class="question">So why is this circle useful?</h4>
<p class="text">Eh.  It's not that useful.  People think that it's some sort of magic that they can't figure out, but there's no magic.  It's just a way of organizing the notes.  The most important aspect of the circle of fifths is that the next note clockwise from any note is its dominant.  So, for an A tonic, the dominant is the next note over, E.  The next most important aspect of the circle of fifths is the thing I marked in the outer ring: two keys a fifth apart share six out of seven notes.  In fact, all seven notes of any given diatonic scale are next to each other.  The C major scale, for instance, contains F, C, G, D, A, E, and B.  (This is also the order of sharps; go widdershins and you have the order of flats.)</p>
<h4 class="question">Widdershins?</h4>
<p class="text">Counterclockwise.  By the way, the circle of fifths continues in both directions.  Past C#, for example, you have G#, D#, A#, E#, B#, Fx, Cx, Gx, Dx, Ax, Ex, Bx, etc. (there's no standard symbol for triple-sharps, so let's just say it's impractical to keep going).  In the other direction, past Cb, we have Fb, Bbb, Ebb, Abb, Dbb, Gbb, Cbb, Fbb, etc. (triple-flats are more obvious — Bbbb, Ebbb, etc. — but they're still impractical).  The reason why those aren't generally shown in these circles is because they don't have standard key signatures.</p>
<p class="text">There's also a little trick for remembering the key signatures.  For sharp major keys, the tonic is the note after the last sharp.  For example, the last sharp in the G major key signature is F#; G is the note after.  In the key signature with 4 sharps, the last sharp is D#, so the tonic is E.  Of course, this only works if you know the order of sharps.  For the flats, the last flat is the next note in the circle of fourths (also known as the circle of fifths going widdershins).  The last flat in F major is Bb, which is the next note over.  In the key signature with 4 flats, the last flat is Db, so the key signature must belong to the previous note on the circle, Ab major.  Some people rely on tricks like these.  I think it's better to just learn the key signatures, but hey, if it helps, whatever.</p>
<p class="text">Another useful pattern: C to F is a perfect fourth up, right?  Well, it's also a perfect fifth <em>down</em>.  This means that any relationships going clockwise are the same as relationships going counterclockwise, just upside down.  In particular, E is a major third above C and has four sharps, so Ab is a major third <em>below</em> C and her four <em>flats</em>.</p>
<p class="text">It's important to realize that in our 12-tone equal-tempered system, the circle is an actual circle; when we go around, we wind up back where we started after 12 fifths (or fourths if we go the other way) if you consider enharmonics like Gb and F# to be the same note.  This is, to put it mildly, <em>magic</em>.  It took <em>centuries</em> to get to this point.  This may sound a bit weird, but you know how we have 12 equal semitones in the chromatic scale?  That wasn't always the case!  In fact, people <em>liked</em> that it wasn't the case, because some music sounded better that way (and other music, unfortunately, sounded worse).  Our perfect fifth is always the same size no matter where it happens in the scale.  C to G is the same interval as Ab to Eb.  Later on, we'll learn about systems where C to G sounded nice — nicer than today, actually — but Ab to Eb sounded <em>horrible</em>, which meant that you essentially couldn't write music in the key of Ab.  This kind of thing is part of <em>microtonal</em> music, which (generally speaking) is music that uses the notes in between the notes of the keyboard (people disagree on the definition of "microtonal", though).  We'll talk about that later.  Not that much later, actually, but later.  It's a bit freaky, but it's also a bit not that freaky.</p>
<p class="text">Let's take a closer look at the key signatures here.  As we go clockwise from C, we add sharps; as we go widdershins, we add flats.  It makes sense to think of a flat as –1 sharp (or a sharp as –1 flat), so we just consistently have this rule about adding sharps or flats when you move in this circle.  The five keys surrounding any given key are the most closely related keys; in 18th century music it's rare for music to modulate to a key other than those closely related keys (and then Beethoven came and that was that).  For example, the closely related keys to C are G, F, Am, Em, and Dm.  This is because neighboring keys share six out of seven notes.  Keys that share fewer notes are said to be distantly related instead of closely related; the most distant key to any key is the one opposite it on the circle — for example, Gb and F# are the farthest keys from C.  The exception to this rule is the relationship between a major key and its parallel minor, so, for example, C and Cm.  They're closely related too.</p>
<h4 class="question">Why C and Cm instead of CM and Cm?  Do you not need to notate major keys like that?</h4>
<p class="text">No.  We can generally assume that a key is major unless told otherwise.  There's actually another convention here used by theorists in more academic circles: a lowercase note name means a minor key.  So instead of saying Dm I could say d.  I'm not that much of an academic so I prefer the popular notation of Dm.  By the way, major and minor keys in German are <em>dur</em> and <em>moll</em>, respectively, meaning "hard" and "soft".  Many pieces of music are labeled by key, and many famous composers spoke German, so this is important to know.  There are actually reasons for why major and minor are associated with hard and soft.  Without going into too much detail (because I don't know it that well), the first note outside the seven white notes to be invented was the Bb.  There were no accidentals then.  There were just the two B's.  The lower one became known as the rounded B, and the higher one became known as the square B.  In German-speaking places, the square-ish B looked kind of like an H, which is why in German, B refers to what we call Bb and H refers to what we call B.  Generally, though, the rounded B evolved into the flat sign (called a "bemol", "soft B"), and the square B evolved into the natural sign (called a "bequadro", "square B").  The sharp came from the next note to be invented, the F#.  The early music stuff is pretty fascinating, but I'm not an expert, so you should try to find other sources of information on it if you're interested.</p>
<h4 class="question">Are there other circles besides the circle of fifths?</h4>
<p class="text">Sure.  The simplest circle is just the circle of semitones, which goes C, C#/Db, D, D#/Eb, etc.  That's not very interesting.  The circle of fifths shows key relationships and other stuff, but the circle of semitones... doesn't.  That's actually the only other circle that's possible in 12-tone equal temperament, since the only positive integers less than and relatively prime to 12 are 1, 5, 7, and 11.  If you go by 1 semitone in one direction, that's the same as going by 11 semitones in the other direction, and 5 and 7 semitones correspond to fourths and fifths, respectively.  But there is one more: the circle of thirds.  This one goes through all 24 <em>keys</em>, so it's a circle of keys rather than of notes.  You can experience it by simply going in a kind of zig-zag pattern through the circle I gave you above: C, Em, G, Bm, D, F#m, A, C#m, E, G#m, B, D#m/Ebm, F#/Gb, Bbm, Db, Fm, Ab, Cm, Eb, Gm, Bb, Dm, F, Am, back to C.</p>
<h4 class="question">What's the point of that?</h4>
<p class="text">I dunno.  For fun, I guess.  Try to come up with your own patterns?  I think we're ready to move on, don't you?</p>

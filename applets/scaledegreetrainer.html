			<p class="text">This is the Offtonic Scale Degree Trainer.  Click on it to start, and click again to stop.  It will play a low tone, which should be interpreted as the tonic of a scale, and then another, higher note; your task is to quickly identify the scale degree, which could be any of 1, #1/b2, 2, #2/b3, 3, 4, #4/b5, 5, #5/b6, 6, #6/b7, and 7.</p>
			<h4 class="question">That's hard.</h4>
			<p class="text">It shouldn't really be.  The problem is that you get a fairly small amount of time to get context.  Learn to use that time wisely, and you'll have a lot less trouble.  With me, I can usually understand the scale degree before I can verbalize it; I may hear a 7 and know that it acts like a 7, but it will take me a few seconds to actually get the number.  It just takes a bit of practice.</p>
			<h4 class="question">Is practicing this game worth it?</h4>
			<p class="text">No?  Maybe.  If you have trouble identifying scale degrees in general, yes, it is.  If you can already do it well, spending the effort to do it faster may just be a waste of your time.  But some people spend time memorizing digits of Ï€.  It's your time to waste!</p>

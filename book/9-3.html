<p class="text">In Baroque times, people used to write accompaniment parts using a notation called <em>figured bass</em>, or <em>thoroughbass</em>, where the bass line is given and little numbers are written below the notes to indicate which other notes to play.  It's kind of like a lead sheet, where the chords are written above the music and an accompanist can just improvise an accompaniment based on the chords, but it's a little more explicit because the actual bass line is there.  An accompanist would have to <em>realize</em> the figured bass, meaning that the accompanist would play a complete accompaniment based on the figured bass instructions.</p>
<h4 class="question">I've never seen this before.  Do I need to know it?</h4>
<p class="text">If you want to play Baroque accompaniment on the cembalo (harpsichord), yes.</p>
<h4 class="question">I do not.</h4>
<p class="text">Well, that's OK.  We won't actually spend much time on how precisely to realize a given figured bass.  We actually had to do this in my music theory class, and it was... well, not pointless, because realizing figured bass helps you internalize smooth voice leading practice.  It's a relatively useful skill, and if you find basically any Baroque or Classical work with a basso continuo on <a href="https://imslp.org/">IMSLP</a>, you can get some practice if you have a keyboard (the <? appletLink('keyboard') ?> likely won't cut it, though you can try).  But that's not why we're learning it here.</p>
<h4 class="question">Oh?  Why are we learning it here, then?</h4>
<p class="text">Because the language of harmonic analysis is based on figured bass notation.  That's one reason.  Another reason is that, prior to the 19th century or so when harmonic analysis became in vogue, people thought about harmony not in terms of triads but in terms of figured bass.  Understanding this will help us understand how to use chords that are not in root position, which is often a little tricky for those who have more experience with pop music than classical music.</p>
<p class="text">Let's see what this looks like.  This is an example from Bach's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZut0eMD8mM">Sonata in Em for Violin and Continuo</a> (start at 1:19; also look at the <a href="http://petrucci.mus.auth.gr/imglnks/usimg/c/c6/IMSLP88639-PMLP06088-BWV_1023.pdf">sheet music</a>):</p>

<? createExample('Bach Sonata Violin Em Adagio'); ?>

<h4 class="question">What are <em>those</em>?</h4>
<p class="text">Figured bass!  If you listen to the video, there's a cello and a harpsichord, which is basically a jazz rhythm section.  Minus the jazz and the rhythm.  So I guess it's just a section.  Anyway, the cello plays the written notes, while the harpsichord plays the chords represented by the numbers.  The basso continuo could have instead been a bassoon and a lute, or a clavichord, or basically any combination of bass instruments and chord-playing instruments.  In this case, it's a violin sonata, so the cello is a good choice for a bass instrument; if it were an oboe sonata, the bassoon would probably be the better choice.  But it's not specified.</p>
<p class="text">The numbers themselves represent notes above the bass that the keyboardist should hit, but the keyboardist should also use his judgment to add things like passing tones, choose chord voicings, add flourishes, etc.  The numbers don't have to be in order (unless specified).  So, at measure 2, where there's a 6 4 2 over the E, that represents the note a 6th above — C — the note a 4th above — A — and the note a 2nd above — F#.  THese notes are in the key signature.  So this is an F#ø7 in third inversion.  Bach really likes to open pieces with something like I - ii42 - V65 - I, or, in minor, i - iiø42 - V65 - i.  He does that here.  You can see in measure 2 beat 2 how he does a 7-6 appoggiatura, which is mirrored in the violin part: over the D#, we first have 7 5, which means the note a 7th above — C — and the note a 5th above — A — and the 7th resolves to the 6th — B.</p>
<h4 class="question">But shouldn't there be a 3 in that chord?  What about the 5 at the resolution?</h4>
<p class="text">Well, you see, figured bass kind of leaves a lot of things out.  The 3 and 5, in particular, are almost never written; it's just assumed that they'll be there if they make sense.  The first measure, for example, is an E minor chord; the 5 and 3 are not written but they should be played.  Here in measure 2, under the D#, the 3 is not written because it should be understood to be there (representing an F#).  The 5 is written because a 6 on its own implies a 6 3 chord, with no 5, but the chord in beat 3 is has the 5.</p>
<h4 class="question">And then... there's a 9th chord?</h4>
<p class="text">Nope!  If you follow the numbers horizontally, it goes 9 8 7 6, all over E's, so what's really happening is that the chord is E minor (5 3), but there's another voice going F# E D C.  That last chord in bar 3 is a C major chord in first inversion, not a 6 5, because the 5 isn't written.  The 9 and 8 actually form a 9-8 suspension (especially if the F# is brought over from the previous chord), and the C starts a 7-6 suspension in bar 4.  Bach is being fairly explicit about his non-harmonic tones here!</p>
<p class="text">Bar 5 we see... a bunch of weird stuff.  First, the # by itself.  Accidentals on their own alter the implicit 3, so the B with the # has a 5, F#, and a #3, D#.  Remember that the numbers refer to notes in the key, not in the chord, so you need the # in order to use the D#, but you don't need the # for F# because that's in the key.  The horizontal line just indicates holding the note, which in this case is the D#.  You may not want to do that given the melody, but Bach thinks you should.  The A has no symbols, which would indicate an A minor chord, but that doesn't make sense in context, so clearly the A is just a passing tone in the bass.  The G# is a 6 5 chord, obviously, but there's a natural next to the 5 (they can be written before or after the number).  That's not strictly necessary (though different publishers might differ on this; figured bass notation was notoriously non-standardized), but it cancels the D# in the violin.  This 6 5 chord (with the 3, remember) is G# B D E in some voicing, and that's a D, not a D#, even though the violin part has a D#.</p>
<p class="text">In the next bar, we have a 6 with a slash.  These slashes happen in different ways for each number in this font and it's a mess to read; measure 8 has a 4 with a slash, measure 11 has a 5, and measure 12 has a 2.  The slash means to raise the note a half step.  In the case of the F# in measure 6, that's a 6 5 3 chord: the 6 is D# (because of the slash), the 5 is C, the 3 is A.  It's a D#o7 in first inversion.  But there's another note there, the 7.  That's E.  What's that doing there?  Probably a passing tone, though the note it resolves to (the F#) isn't marked at the downbeat of 7.</p>
<p class="text">The only other odd thing here is the (6) in bar 12.  This 6 was likely added by the editor to indicate something that might have been obvious in Bach's time but isn't obvious in the editor's.  The parentheses have no special meaning.</p>
<p class="text">Other figured bass conventions not covered: a 2 on its own could be a 6 4 2 chord or part of a 2-3 suspension figure in the bass.  An accidental that's <em>not</em> a natural generally raises or lowers a chord tone regardless of the key signature (so if the note is a Bb in the key signature, the # would make it B natural, not B sharp), while the natural actually makes it a natural.  Different publishers do this bit differently too.  A forward slash can indicate lowering a note by a half-step, but that's rare, which is good because it would get confusing really quickly.  A 0 or <em>tasto solo</em> indicate that the bass part should be played on its own, without improvised chords.  A bunch of 8's in a row would mean to play the bass part alone, but in octaves.  A row of 6's or 10's would indicate parallel 6ths or 10ths.  I think that's about it.</p>
<h4 class="question">So what would this improvised accompaniment line sound like?</h4>
<p class="text">Listen to the video!  Another possibility might go something like this:</p>

<? createExample('Bach Sonata Violin Em Adagio Realized'); ?>

<p class="text">I wrote in just the right hand of the harpsichord.  The left hand plays the notated continuo part.  I'm not going to claim that it's the best thing ever, but that's really just it; if Bach wanted the best thing ever, he'd have written the damn thing himself!  Instead, Bach just wants to provide accompaniment.  The chords generally move the minimum amount possible while avoiding parallel fifths and octaves (well, if I did it correctly, that is) so that the accompaniment is smooth and doesn't compete with the soloist playing the melody.  The small problem here is that Bach, as you have hopefully realized, <em>loves</em> counterpoint, so there are countermelodies and non-harmonic tones and all that stuff up the wazoo, distracting the listener from the main event.  Eh.  You do what you can.</p>
<p class="text">We generally realize the continuo in four-part harmony, with the bass being the given line, but that's not required.  The first chord has six voices, for example, because I like how that sounds.  Sometimes, it's worth dropping a voice for a few chords, like if there are parallel 6ths; I almost did that at 14 but I realized that I could do better.  A few times a voice gets doubled, though, which is almost the same as dropping it.  At 3, for example, the last chord is G C C.  Last beat of 12, I also switch the tenor and soprano: the low D goes up to the high D and stays there forever.  In a choral piece, this wouldn't work, but this is a keyboard accompaniment, so who's gonna stop me?  Also, at 15 I decided to add a voice to heighten the tension and make the voice leading a bit easier.  Bach adds voices sometimes, so why can't I?</p>
<p class="text">When realizing a figured bass, you move the voices as little as possible, but sometimes that creates problems with range, when things get too low or too high.  To correct that, or just to change it up, you can re-voice a chord while holding it.  I do this in measure 9 (the rest doesn't make the accompaniment go away, as you can see in measure 11), where in measure 9 beat 2 I re-voice the chord lower, and on beat 3 I put it in open position instead of closed position.  It's trickier to play that way, since you need to use the left hand to reach the tenor note, but I'm not playing this on a real harpsichord so what do I care?</p>
<p class="text">I also added arpeggiated chords fairly regularly.  Why?  Because I think it sounds nice; it gives a bit of emphasis to the chord.  I think the effect is particularly tasteful on beat 3 of most of the measures in this section of the piece, giving a bit more weight to the upbeats, but not every measure.  An example is at 14, where the arpeggio would halt the forward momentum rather than push it.  The arpeggio slows down the chord, and I didn't want to do that here.  I had the benefit of being able to think about how I was going to place each note; a real improvising accompanist has to do this all by instinct.  When you immerse yourself in the musical idioms of the Baroque period — because, say, you live in the Baroque period — you get an intuitive feel for how this music plays out and you can be ready to improvise in a familiar way.</p>
<p class="text">When theory students read figured bass, it's a <em>lot</em> simpler than this piece, and generally it doesn't have non-harmonic tones.</p>
<h4 class="question">Then why is this one so complex?</h4>
<p class="text">Because I'm <em>not</em> asking you to play it.  Instead, I'm asking you to understand what the numbers mean and why they're there.  The simpler figured bass exercises generally just have a few chords in root position and first inversion, maybe a 7th chord or two, and focus on internalizing harmonic voice leading.  This means you'd sit at the piano and practice moving the notes from one chord to the next as smoothly as possible, avoiding parallel fifths and octaves, etc.  There are a few techniques for how to do this that we'll discuss later.  Then you'd do it again, but pick a different note to start in the soprano.  This way, you'd get practice being fast at voice leading.  But theory exercises <em>aren't real music</em>.</p>
<h4 class="question">Sure they are.  They're meant to be music, are they not?</h4>
<p class="text">OK, they are.  I guess that was kind of elitist.  But still.  When I say they're not real music, I mean that they were meant to be exercises, not to fulfill some grand artistic vision.  In the Baroque and Classical periods, people wrote their music using figured bass as their notation.  It wasn't just exercises; this was meant to be appreciated as art rather than just as didactic material.  So we get this very detailed, very complex set of numbers, because Bach's ideas were detailed and complex.</p>
<p class="text">Playing figured bass like this is something that really you'd only ever do if you joined a period ensemble.  Most likely you'd just get an edition with the figured bass already realized for you, since having to improvise Baroque accompaniments is just not in a lot of musicians' wheelhouses.  But realizing a complicated figured bass is a fun compositional exercise, so let's see why I made some of the choices I made.</p>
<p class="text">We begin at measure 1.  The video does a little flourish at this point, but I'm not skilled enough to compose that kind of thing in the right style, so I opted for a simpler arpeggio that still fills the gap in the violin with something less boring than a four-part chord.  I also played around with what I wanted to put in the soprano.  I liked the E because it goes into the next measure nicely, but it shadows the violin, which could be desirable or perhaps not.  In measure 2, I continue from measure 1 but I do a little flourish when resolving the 7-6.  I don't feel too bad about doubling the violin here because the figured bass explicitly requires it, and that makes me more willing to not avoid the violin part.  Measure 3, we have that 9 8 7 6 thing, and since the 9 was already in the previous chord, the choice of voicing is easy.  The conflict came at beat 3, where there was no more B.  My usual idea would have been to voice the chord E G C, but that E could cause problems going into the next chord, and it would double the third needlessly, so I opted to just double the C with the soprano and alto.  You can't tell that I did that just from looking at the chord, but that's OK.</p>
<p class="text">In measure 4, the figured bass lends itself to that C B A melody in the alto.  The first inversion voicing there, C E A E, doubles the fifth, and it's a common first inversion voicing.  Going into the downbeat of 5 is easy, with no awkward intervals necessary; everything moves by step.  I didn't need to re-voice the chord on beat 2, but I wanted to for variety.  I spent some time figuring out how to deal with the next chord, and I realized that the B and D form a double suspension in measure 6.  I had originally put the D below the E, to maintain the voicing of the second chord, but it sounds better with the double suspension in thirds, so I moved it back.  There's a cross-relation between the D# in the tenor and the D natural in the soprano, but I don't think it's offensive.</p>
<p class="text">Measure 6 is straightforward, but measure 7 still sounds weird to me on beat 2.  I couldn't figure out a way to play those notes (required by the figured bass) without conflicting with the violin.  Taking things down an octave would conflict with the bass instead, since I wanted to keep the upper lines going from the previous bar.  Maybe there's a solution, but I didn't spend too much time on it because in real life this would have been improvised anyway.  Measure 8 beat 2, that's a first inversion chord with a doubled third, but it lines up with the doubled neighbor tones just before.  I didn't bother to write a chord over the A with the 7 5 because those notes were already in the chord.  In measure 9, I did the same re-voicing that I'd done in measure 5 — hey, I've used it twice, so now it's a motif!</p>
<p class="text">The last beat of measure 9 I decided I wanted a different voicing, so I spread things out.  On a real harpsichord, that low B would be played by the left hand, so it's not an impossible stretch.  But the figured bass foiled my plans, because the downbeat of 10 is a 7th chord and my top voice had the passing tone that had to resolve down.</p>
<h4 class="question">But what if it was a neighbor tone and therefore resolved up?</h4>
<p class="text">...Hm.  Good point.  I could have done that, but I think resolving down sounds more satisfying.  I guess that's why I didn't even consider going up.  In fact, given the F# - E - F# figure in the next chord, maybe I should have done E - D - E.  Oh well!  I tried to keep the open voicing going for a bit longer, but it became simpler to just keep the closed voicing.  Measure 11 has that augmented chord on beat 2, which is nice to see, but the D# is just a neighbor sonority.  12 again has the first inversion voicing with the doubled fifth, which would easily lead to more open voicings, but beat 2 has a <em>voice overlap</em>: the bass B on beat 2 is higher than the tenor A on beat 1.  Since I had to deal with that high bass, I opted to just go back to closed voicing and not bother with <em>voice crossing</em>, which is when a lower voice is above a higher voice.  (Voice overlap is when a voice goes higher than a higher voice did in the previous chord; voice crossing is when a voice is currently higher than a higher voice.)</p>
<p class="text">Measure 12 beat 3, I do something magical: I stick the tenor above the soprano.  That would be a voice crossing, but then... I just keep it there.  So, from measure 13 on, what was once the tenor is now the soprano.  If a different instrument were playing each voice, it would be important to figure out which is which, but on keyboard it doesn't matter.  Bach tends to avoid this kind of thing, but I'm not Bach.  Suck it, JS.</p>
<p class="text">Measure 14 I have to double a voice again.  The chord at the downbeat of 14 is D F# C, with no A, because the C is part of a 7-6 suspension.  The prudent thing to do is to just double the bass, but I can't do that because it would create parallel octaves: the E in bar 13 would go to the D in 14 in both the tenor and bass parts.  So I opted to just double the F# instead.  Same thing on beat 2, plus the alto gets a nice scalar line, E F# G G.  The eighth notes don't stop there, though; they keep going right through bar 15.  Since they push forward, I decided to highlight that push by adding a fifth voice... which has parallel octaves.  OOPS.  Second to third eighth notes, you see the B's going to C#'s?  That's no good.  Maybe I should have stuck to four, huh?</p>
<p class="text">Bar 16 turns down the tension from the previous bar with, again, the smoothest possible motion between the chords, with each voice moving as little as possible.  The excerpt ends on Bm, but don't think that the piece does; this is just a short excerpt (the piece ends as it begins, in Em).  There's some interesting figured bass in the rest of the piece, so check out the <a href="http://petrucci.mus.auth.gr/imglnks/usimg/c/c6/IMSLP88639-PMLP06088-BWV_1023.pdf">sheet music</a>.</p>
<h4 class="question">OK, then, what was the point of all this?</h4>
<p class="text">The first chord in measure 2 is an E with 6 4 2 written underneath it.  These notes are E F# A C, given the key signature.  You and I know this as an F#ø7 chord in third inversion, but in Bach's time, it was just an E with various intervals above it, a dissonant 2, a dissonant 4, and a consonant 6.  In measure 3, the third chord is an E with a 6 below it, which is short for 6 3; the notes are E G C.  You and I know this as a C major chord in first inversion, but in Bach's time, it was just an E with various intervals above it, a consonant 3 and a consonant 6.  Of course Bach knew, in both cases, that the same notes could be written as stacks of thirds, starting from F# in the first chord and C in the second, but in his time, people just didn't quite think of F# A C E and E F# A C as the same entity, though they were heading in that direction.  This reflects the way they thought about polyphony during the Renaissance, as intervals between voices, which could be consonant or dissonant, rather than as chords.</p>
<p class="text">Try to compare figured bass to pop chord notation.  This is a good comparison, because both of them serve the same purpose: to tell an accompanying musician what to improvise on.  They both have basically the same information.  From measure 1, you'd have Em; then in measure 2, F#ø7/E, D#o7, B7/D#; in measure 3, Em(add9) Em Em7 C/E; in measure 4, DM7, Bm/D, Am/C; and so on.  You don't get the octave of the bass voice, but otherwise, it's all the same stuff.  However, pop notation tells you the root of the chord, while figured bass does not.  The root of the chord is interesting for theorists but it's not actually relevant to the music.  We can see this in measure 4, where the first chord doesn't even contain the root since it's suspended.  The pop chord symbol I used, DM7, isn't exactly appropriate.  Pop notation focuses on communicating the chord as a triad plus stuff; figured bass makes no such assumption and could theoretically be used to describe literally any chord (though it still omits information about how to voice said chord).  Figured bass focuses on horizontal motion as well, since a non-harmonic tone is just a number rather than a whole new chord.</p>
<h4 class="question">So figured bass notation is better than pop chord notation?</h4>
<p class="text">It's better at conveying the essence of the type of music it was designed for, and pop chord notation is better at conveying the essence of the type of music <em>it</em> was designed for.  Figured bass notation can handle much more complex parts, but the downside is that it's hard to read quickly unless you're really good at it, and it's filled with shorthand notations that make the process simpler for more usual figures like root position triads.  It also requires a staff.  Pop chord notation, on the other hand, is far easier to read and can be written with simple symbols, and the music that uses it doesn't try to convey horizontal details of the harmonic line; the harmony is <em>just</em> the harmony, and any polyphony is incidental.  But if you try to do some more interesting stuff with your music, pop chord notation quickly shows its limitations.  The important difference between them is how they represent two different approaches to <em>thinking</em> about harmony, as individual chords versus as confluences of melodic voices.  Classical music generally leans on that second interpretation, while pop music tends to lean on the first.  And if you want to write music that's more detailed than pop music, more subtle and perhaps more sophisticated (not that there's anything wrong with the simple and the in-your-face), then you should internalize the figured bass way of thinking about harmony so that you can use it when appropriate.  <em>That's</em> why understanding figured bass is important.</p>
<p class="text">Also, the notation is heavily borrowed for Roman numeral analysis, which is what we're actually learning in this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="question">Oh yeah, that.</h4>
<p class="text">So let's see it in action!</p>

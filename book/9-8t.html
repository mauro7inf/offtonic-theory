<p class="text">One of the most important functions of harmony is to provide closure to a musical idea, even if it's only partial closure to the first half of the musical idea to signal that the second half is still to come.  That closure is called a <em>cadence</em>.</p>
<h4 class="question">Cadence, like, your affect, etc. when you talk?</h4>
<p class="text">Sigh.  So, unfortunately, the word "cadence" has several meanings in music.  One example of a cadence is a drum cadence, which is a piece of music played by a drum section of a marching group while said group marches.  Here is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zyyAa_Z12M">my high school's drum cadence</a>.  Sorry for the quality, but it's the only video I could find.  This a field performance of the cadence, though; the "native" situation in which it would happen is that we'd be marching somewhere, and the drum line would play this or another cadence to keep time.  Another meaning of the word "cadence" is the one you mentioned: the cadence of your speech is its rhythm, its intonation, its phrase length, how long you wait in between words, etc.  Cadence in speech is often a first symptom into some possible neurological problems.  There's also the cadenza, a solo section of a piece of music played out of time.  All of these come from the Latin "cadere", meaning to fall, but the cadence we're going to talk about in this section is the one that comes at the end of a phrase to tell us that the phrase has ended.  As a very simple example, consider Stephen Foster's song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSIj17xbAyk">Oh Susanna</a> (be aware that, um, racism; this song might be beloved Americana today, but in its original form it would not be so beloved, I hope):</p>

<p class="text">The cadences are marked with fermatas at measures 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24.  A cadence marks where a phrase ends, so these are, naturally, four-bar phrases.  The melody actually <em>stops</em> at the cadences.  We'll find that this doesn't always happen, but if it doesn't have some sense of <em>ending</em> something, it's not a cadence, even if it otherwise looks like one.  This song is written here in G major, and, as you can see, the cadences at measures 8, 16, and 24 end on the G, the tonic, while the cadences at measures 4, 12, and 20 do not.  A cadence that ends on the I chord is called a full cadence, while the one that ends on the V is a half-cadence.  This makes a bit less sense when we're looking at a melody that isn't accompanied by a harmony, but, then again, the implied harmony is obvious here: the cadences at 4, 12, and 20 are half-cadences, while the cadences at 8, 16, and 24 are full cadences.</p>
<p class="text">Cadences turn out to be very interesting and it's very useful to study them in depth, so... that's what we're gonna do now!</p>

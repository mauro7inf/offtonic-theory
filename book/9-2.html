<p class="text">When we analyze a chord, we first need to figure out which notes are in the chord.</p>
<h4 class="question">...All of them, right?</h4>
<p class="text">Well...  Not really.  You can definitely hear it that way if you want, but when we do an analysis, part of our goal is to <em>reduce</em> the music to more understandable pieces.  Some notes don't behave as if they're part of the harmony; we're not supposed to hear them as notes of the chord.  We call these <em>non-harmonic tones</em>.  They certainly contribute to the <em>macroharmony</em>, the wider sense of mode that the piece has, but they're not members of the current chord.  These come in quite a few different flavors, which we'll see below.</p>
<h4 class="question">Why would a composer include non-harmonic tones?  Won't they sound bad if they aren't in the chord?</h4>
<p class="text">They sound <em>dissonant</em>, not bad.  This is a word we'll see again and again: a dissonant interval is one that requires resolution, while a consonant interval is one that does not.  In Common Practice music, the consonant intervals are P1's, m3's and M3's, P4's <em>when not above the bass</em>, P5's, m6's and M6's, P8's, and all of their composite intervals (like tenths, twelfths, etc.).  Augmented and diminished intervals are always dissonant, as are seconds and sevenths, and the P4 is dissonant when above the bass.  In more recent music, whether an interval is treated as a consonance or a dissonance is more complicated and up to the composer; in jazz, for example, it's not unusual to hear a mM7 chord as not requiring resolution despite the (usually) dissonant M7 and the even more dissonant A5 between the b3 and 7 of the chord.</p>
<p class="text">Some dissonance is good: it provides tension, which is then satisfyingly released.  But for it to be good, it needs to actually be satisfying.  It needs to feel natural and resolve naturally.  Non-harmonic tones are ways in which composers manage their dissonance.</p>
<p class="text">Some people call them <em>embellishment tones</em> instead.  That point of view looks at them from a melodic perspective rather than a purely harmonic one, and that's a perspective that we will also use.  Embellishment tones take a simple melody and make it more interesting, or they take a harmony and make it more interesting.  To that effect, we'll include an example or two that's actually <em>not</em> non-harmonic.</p>

<h3 class="subsection-title" id="embellishing-tones">9.2.1 List of Embellishing Tones</h3>

<p class="text">I wrote this little chorale-type piece to demonstrate the embellishing tones that have commonly-used names:</p>

<? createExample('non harmonic'); ?>

<h4 class="question">Some of this chorale sucks.</h4>
<p class="text">Shut up.  It's not a real chorale.  It's just to demonstrate stuff.</p>
<h4 class="question">And wait, wait, wait.  Are those... parallel fifths?</h4>
<p class="text">Shhh.  Yep.  We won't talk about them for a little while yet, though, so just sit tight.  At least if we're talking about the same thing.</p>
<p class="text">Before we go through these, I just want to point out a notational thing or two.  These non-harmonic tones have <em>fairly</em> standard abbreviations, which you may see here and there.  I'll only use them if I feel like the non-harmonic tone is important enough to bother.  I wanted to circle the noteheads for the non-harmonic tones, but Sibelius doesn't make it easy so I didn't.  Also, quite a few non-harmonic tones actually get labeled with figured bass numerals, and chromatic ones may even get figured bass accidentals.  Which Sibelius is bad at representing.  So use your imagination; when you see a number by itself, assume that it's connected to the previous number.  The little dashes near the numbers represent the failures of Sibelius's Roman numeral input system's usability.</p>
<p class="text">We'll start with the non-non-harmonic tones.  In measure 1 we have the chordal leap, which happens in the soprano, alto, and tenor.  A <em>chordal leap</em> is just when a voice moves from a chord tone to another chord tone on the same chord.  Such motions are generally "free" in that they don't usually detract from the overall voice leading.  When you have several chordal leaps in a row in the same direction, like in the bass at measure 9, that's an <em>arpeggio</em>.  Chordal leaps and arpeggios allow for consonant motion without changing the chord.</p>
<p class="text">The simplest non-harmonic tones are the passing tones.  A <em>passing tone</em> is when two chord tones are connected by non-chord tones in a scale.  The tenor in measure 1 goes from a D, which is the fifth of the G major chord, to the F, which is the root of the F major chord, by passing through the E.  Passing tones generally happen on weak beats, but the soprano at measure 3 has a passing tone B on the downbeat between the C and the A, which we call an <em>accented passing tone</em>.  Passing tones can also come in multiples; the tenor in measure 2 has two passing tones between the F and the C.  In measure 4, the alto has what could be considered a passing tone as well, the D# between the D and the E.  This one's a bit more open to interpretation because you could consider the D# to be a chord tone of a G+ chord.  On the other hand, in measure 7 beat 2, the tenor has an A# that's definitely a non-harmonic tone (which I didn't label because I was labeling other things that measure).  This is a <em>chromatic passing tone</em> because it fills in the chromatic scale between the pitches.</p>
<h4 class="question">So is the D# in measure 4 a chromatic passing tone or not?</h4>
<p class="text">Yes it is, 100%.  The question is whether it's harmonic or non-harmonic.  For example, in measure 2 beat 3, the bass has an E linking the F and the D.  That's a passing tone too, but it's harmonic.  In fact, that entire I6 chord sits between the IV and ii chords; you could consider the whole chord to be a passing chord.</p>
<h4 class="question">What makes a chord a passing chord?</h4>
<p class="text">Many people wonder the same thing.  The answer, of course, is open to interpretation, but passing chords are less important than the chords around them.  Somehow, the I6 is part of a transition rather than a destination.</p>
<h4 class="question">I don't hear it.</h4>
<p class="text">Yeah, me neither.  But the argument could be made that the I6 is a passing chord.  (The V/ii in measure 6 is <em>definitely</em> a passing chord, though.)  Instead, I hear the first two bars as embellishment on the I chord, while bars 3 and 4 have a ii - V - I.  The V at the end of bar 4 is, to me, just embellishment of the next I at 5.  A chord that sits at the end of a section and is the dominant into the next section is often called a <em>turnaround</em>.</p>
<p class="text">The next class of non-harmonic tones is the neighbor tone.  A <em>neighbor tone</em> (or <em>auxiliary tone</em>) is when a chord tone goes up a step then back down to the same note for an upper neighbor, or down then up for a lower neighbor.  In measure 6, the soprano first goes C B C, making the B a lower neighbor, then C D C, making the D an upper neighbor.  Neighbor tones can also be chromatic, like in measure 7 beat 1 in the tenor, with the G#.  You could argue that the G# in measure 6 is part of the scale of the vi, but in measure 7 we've established the G natural the previous beat, so the G# is not in the scale.  You could have <em>double neighbor tones</em>, also known as <em>changing tones</em> or <em>cambiata</em>, which are when both neighbor tones are used before returning to the original note, like in the soprano at measure 9 beat 2 (and again at measure 11 beat 2).  Here the lower comes before the upper, but it could go in either direction.  The turn, which we learned about back in <? sectionLinkShort('notation ornaments'); ?>, uses changing tones, and mordents and inverted mordents use upper and lower neighbor tones.  <em>Neighbor chords</em> work on the same principle, where you go from a chord to another chord (where most voices move by step) then back to the original chord.  I didn't write any of those here.</p>
<p class="text">An <em>incomplete neighbor tone</em> is when you have a neighbor tone but without one of the instances of the chord tone.  If you had B C B, C is the neighbor tone, but in the soprano in measure 13, the first B is missing, so the C is an incomplete neighbor tone.  Incomplete neighbor tones are not accented, generally.  If they are, like in measures 10 and 11 in the tenor, they're called <em>appoggiaturas</em> instead.  The <em>escape tone</em>, or <em>echappée</em>, is an incomplete neighbor tone where it's the second note that's missing rather than the first.  The incomplete neighbor tone and the appoggiatura are approached by leap and resolve by step (in the opposite direction), while the escape tone is approached by step and resolved by leap (again, in the opposite direction).</p>
<h4 class="question">What happens if you resolve them in the same direction?</h4>
<p class="text">Then they don't have special names!  Nothing wrong with that.  Actually, in Common Practice voice leading there is something wrong with that, but who cares, really?  Not Common Practice composers, who wrote that kind of thing pretty often anyway.</p>
<p class="text">The last class of non-harmonic tones is when resolutions don't happen squarely.  In an <em>anticipation</em>, a chord tone from the <em>next</em> chord shows up early.  You can see this in the soprano in measures 7 and 15, where the C is part of the next chord but it happens an eighth note early.  In contrast, a <em>suspension</em> is when a note resolves late.  In a suspension, a chord tone is held from the previous chord and resolves on the weak beat, like the tenor at measure 3.  I'd ordinarily write that as a dotted half note, but I wanted to show exactly where the suspension is.  Suspensions get notated in the figured bass.  Suspensions are special in that they always have preparation and resolution.  The preparation requires holding the suspended note in the previous chord, and the resolution is always down by step.  In Common Practice music, the usual suspensions are 4-3, 9-8, 7-6, 6-5, and, when it's in the bass, 2-3.  We'll talk about what these numbers mean shortly.  You <em>could</em> have additional suspensions, but in Common Practice music they largely didn't.  Suspensions always resolve down, not up.  If it resolves up, it's called a <em>retardation</em>.  There's one of those at measure 12 in the alto (again, it would normally be a dotted half note but I wanted to show it clearly).</p>
<p class="text">Suspensions generally involve a note being held over, but the note <em>could</em> be restruck, as in the soprano between measures 3 and 4.  They also don't need to resolve right away, as that same suspension demonstrates by being decorated with the neighbor tone 16th note figure.</p>
<p class="text">This is where I'd give you a summary of which non-harmonic tones are approached by leap or by step and which resolve by leap or by step, but I won't because all that stuff is completely obvious just by looking at the example.  I should say, though, that most dissonances resolve down by step in the Common Practice Period.</p>
<p class="text">Several of these non-harmonic tones are actually fairly similar: the accented passing tone, the appoggiatura, and the suspension.  All of these involve a dissonant note on the downbeat that resolves by step.  The difference is how that note is approached: if it's by step in the same direction that it resolves in, it's an accented passing tone; if it's by leap (usually in the opposite direction), it's an appoggiatura; if the note is held over, it's a suspension.</p>
<h4 class="question">How important is that distinction?</h4>
<p class="text">It's... not.  I mean, when analyzing, you generally want to use the right words, but these accented non-harmonic tones are substantially similar.  They actually have performance implications, because you generally want to get more intense into a suspension (or accented passing tone or appoggiatura).  In pop music, they're pretty much all suspensions (including retardations).  I tend to just call them all suspensions as well, because I frankly don't see the importance of their having different names when they're basically the same thing.  But I didn't come up with the naming scheme.</p>
<p class="text"><? exampleLink('non harmonic'); ?> shows the non-harmonic tones in context, so you can see how they interact with chord boundaries.  For example, in measure 2 in the tenor, we have the E and D as passing tones from the F, which is in the first chord, to C, which is in the second chord.  The E is also in the second chord, but since it sounds during the first chord, it's still non-harmonic.  Below, though, we have a summary of the embellishment tones without context to make them easier to remember:</p>

<? createExample('non harmonic summary'); ?>

<p class="text">There's nothing new in this example to talk about, so... I won't talk about anything in this example.</p>
<h4 class="question">I have no questions about it.</h4>
<p class="text">I'm glad you got it.</p>
<h4 class="question">Actually, never mind, I do have some questions.  What happened to the other two voices?</h4>
<p class="text">I didn't need them to demonstrate the non-harmonic tones.  Just because we like to analyze music with four neat voices doesn't mean that all music has four neat voices, and the concept of non-harmonic tones continues to apply.  You should hopefully understand the chords anyway.  Those with a C in the bottom are I harmonies in C major, those with a B are V6 or viio harmonies, and the one with an A is a IV6.  In four-voice writing, root-position diminished triads are avoided because they sound unbalanced, but in two-voice writing that's not an issue.  Notice that I called them harmonies here rather than chords.  They <em>aren't</em> chords.  They're dyads at best.  The measures with the chordal leap and arpeggio, for example, are <em>clearly</em> C major harmonies, but they aren't chords in the vertical sense.</p>
<h4 class="question">So in the passing tone measures, what's stopping that F from being part of an F major chord in second inversion?</h4>
<p class="text">Nothing other than your imagination.  Really, any combination of notes can be a harmony, even if it's dissonant.  In practice, though, the harmonic language of the Common Practice Period did not consider such dissonant structures to be <em>the</em> chords of the piece.  The whole purpose of talking about non-harmonic tones is so that we can understand which notes "count" and which notes don't.  If a note behaves like one of these non-harmonic tones, it signals to us, the listener, that the note isn't a fundamental part of the chord and it's really there to embellish something more basic.  What is structural and what is ornamental can blend into each other, but the distinction allows us to more easily reduce the sounds we hear into digestible chunks of information.</p>
<p class="text">Here's an analogy: a young woman goes to a nightclub in winter, wearing the usual clubbing attire.  Women's clothes suitable for a nightclub are generally not very substantial, so in order to not freeze to death on the way, she also wears a winter coat.  However, aesthetics are an important part of the clubbing experience, so she wears clothes that match, with colors that go together and complement each other, shoes that contribute to the overall look, a handbag and jewelry that signal whatever she wants to signal, etc.  Everything works together except her winter coat, which looks nice enough but doesn't particularly go with the rest of the getup.  Of course, as soon as she gets inside, she removes the coat anyway because it's hot inside and the coat gets in the way of dancing.  Question: is the coat part of the ensemble?  Each piece of her outfit is a note in the chord, but the coat is a note that doesn't fit the chord and gets resolved.  That coat is a non-harmonic tone.  Sure, she could wear a coat that matches if she's rich enough, but usually the coat doesn't match the rest of the outfit, and it doesn't have to match: when she takes off the coat and reveals the outfit underneath, that's a resolution to the tension of the hidden outfit, just like when a non-harmonic tone resolves.  If the coat matched, the reveal wouldn't be as interesting, since it would just be more of the same outfit.  If you wanted to describe the outfit, you wouldn't mention the coat she was wearing over it — not as part of it, but over it.</p>
<p class="text">I emphasize this distinction because the way people think about pop music, non-harmonic tones aren't involved.  In part there's the influence of jazz, where a note that's not part of the base chord is still considered part of the extended chord.  If I play a D over a C major chord, that's a C(add9) instead of just C with a D over it.  The other part is that non-harmonic tones are dissonances and behave as such, but pop music often doesn't treat them like dissonances.  That added D may just not resolve, so why <em>wouldn't</em> we hear it as part of the chord?  However, resolving dissonances can make music much richer, since it provides different levels of notes, the notes in the chord and the notes not in the chord.  Pop music still uses non-harmonic tones in the <em>melody</em>, but looking at melodies is surprisingly unpopular among the self-taught music theory crowd.  The concept of non-harmonic tones really applies only when there are separate voices, which you tend to have when there's a melody against an accompaniment; the bass line of the accompaniment is generally also an independent voice, but the inner harmonies tend to just be block chords.  So you get stuff like added 6th chords, sus4 and sus2 chords, add9 and 6/9 chords, 13th chords, and so on, where the added stuff is not critical to the function of the chord and it would be a dissonance that resolves within the chord except that the unresolved dissonance is part of the style.</p>
<h4 class="question">Resolve within the chord?</h4>
<p class="text">Yeah.  A dissonant chord resolves to another chord; the dissonances there are integral to the chord itself.  An example is a V7 chord, which has that dissonant b7 that needs to resolve.  A non-harmonic tone is a level more dissonant than that; it tends to want to resolve to a consonant note in the same chord.  That's not the case for passing tones or neighbor tones, necessarily, which can connect notes of different chords, but it's the case for suspensions and the like.  If you look back at <? exampleLink('non harmonic summary'); ?>, in the suspension measure, the second harmony is C major.  It starts out as C F (the F is dissonant because it's a P4 above the bass), and the dissonant F resolves to E without the chord changing.</p>
<h4 class="question">Are there any <em>other</em> non-harmonic tones?</h4>
<p class="text">Yes... sort of.  We'll cover the pedal point in <? sectionLinkShort('analysis nonharmonic pedals'); ?>.  Some consider the <em>syncopation</em>, which is when a chord tone (or multiple chord tones) happens during the weak beat before the chord itself, to be a kind of non-harmonic tone, but it's really just an anticipation where the note doesn't get restruck.  Other than that, you're likely to find, in more modern music, non-harmonic tones that aren't prepared and don't resolve.  This is pretty rare in Common Practice music, but in modern music that has harmonic tones at all, you'll sometimes hear non-harmonic tones that are simply there.  For example, if you play C F B G over a C major chord, the F and B aren't part of the chord; they're angular and dissonant and not smooth like the non-harmonic tones we've discussed.  That kind of thing makes for unsingable melodies, which is often undesirable in vocal writing, but sometimes you just want to be contrary!</p>
<p class="text">Also, a warning: different theorists actually label non-harmonic tones differently.  Some authors, for example, don't differentiate between a suspension and a retardation.  For some authors, passing tones are always non-accented; an accented passing tone is actually an appoggiatura, as is a restruck suspension.  The fact is that it doesn't <em>really</em> matter what you call it exactly, so long as you know what you're talking about and can make yourself understood.  The music will sound the same regardless.  The only thing that changes is the language we use to talk about it, and not even by that much!</p>

<h3 class="subsection-title" id="non-harmonic-wild">9.2.2 Non-Harmonic Tones In the Wild</h3>

<p class="text">I'd like to pause here and analyze a piece that <em>isn't</em> a Bach chorale, but interesting non-harmonic tones are honestly pretty hard to come by in popular music, and there needs to be sheet music available in any case.  So, how about Albéniz's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNUpWAQuuVA">Tango in D</a> (sheet music at <a href="https://imslp.org/wiki/Espa%C3%B1a%2C_Op.165_(Alb%C3%A9niz%2C_Isaac)">IMSLP</a>)?  (I won't synthesize a recording since I'm transcribing as written.)</p>

<? createExample('Albeniz Tango'); ?>

<p class="text">Above is the first third or so of this short and sweet piece.  It's not too difficult to play.  I left out the pedal markings because they get in the way of the analysis symbols; I hope you don't mind.  I want to talk about the chords first, because for something to be non-harmonic it needs to contrast with something harmonic.</p>
<h4 class="question">Isn't the point of doing non-harmonic tones first to understand what's <em>not</em> a chord so that we can figure out what the chord is?</h4>
<p class="text">A little circular reasoning never hurt anyone!  Wait, that's not true.  Still!</p>
<p class="text">In the Bach chorales, the chords are nice and clear.  Here, though, right in the first measure we start with a D in the bass, but then we go to an A in the bass.  That should be a change in chord, right?  Wrong.  It happens on a weak beat, so while it's certainly not non-harmonic, it's also not the real bass of the chord, which is on the strong beat.  We don't consider the chord as having changed when the bass part has interesting stuff unless the other parts make it clear that it should be heard as a new chord.  In addition, this piece of music is mostly in only three voices, so we have to take the implied harmonies as well as the given ones.  For example, in measure 6, the A doesn't appear until beat 2, but it does appear, so it makes sense to call that harmony a V43 instead of viio6 in the first beat and V7 in the second.  You're free to disagree with my analysis.</p>
<p class="text">But let's talk about the non-harmonic tones — that's what we came here for, right?  We can see lots of passing and neighbor tones — melodies are generally made of scale steps, so passing and neighbor tones are natural.  Even pop melodies have passing tones and neighbor tones.  But some of the ones here deserve special mention.  This piece has a particular motif that happens to be a non-harmonic tone: the descending step on a downbeat.  You can see it at the downbeat of measure 8, measure 10 (where it also gets inverted in the alto), and in measure 15 (where it's in a triplet), as well as on weak beats in measures 3, 5 (inverted and rhythmically diminished in the alto), 7, 11, 13, and 17.  Similar figures happen in the bass at 14 and 18, but their rhythmic position is too weak to count.  Which precise class of non-harmonic tone it is varies based on context, but in all of these cases (other than the bass), the figure is an accented non-harmonic tone that resolves to a harmonic tone.</p>
<p class="text">In a few cases, the analysis wasn't clear.  In measure 3, for example, is that G an appoggiatura (an accented neighbor tone) or an accented passing tone (which is also a kind of appoggiatura, but anyway)?  It depends on how important you consider the grace notes.  On a structural level, the grace notes don't count, so the G is a neighbor tone to the F#'s around it, but the grace notes <em>are</em> there, so the G is an accented passing tone from the A down to the F#.  Both analyses are useful, so there's no reason to pick just one.  The same situation happens in measure 18 in the bass.  (Why does the same situation happen twice in this short excerpt?  Because Albeniz is using it as a motif!)</p>
<p class="text">Another interesting ambiguity is at measure 7, where the B could be heard as a 9th rather than as a dissonance.  I'm actually OK with that, but Roman numerals for 9th chords are not well-recognized, since the kind of Common Practice music the Roman numerals were invented to describe don't really use 9ths.  On the other hand, if we consider the chord a viiø7, it's no longer a 9th, but it actually makes sense as a dissonance because it gets resolved up to the C#.  When the note happens in measure 8, though, it's not treated as a dissonance.  Again, there's ambiguity here, and that's more a failure of our vocabulary than anything else.</p>
<p class="text">But what's <em>really</em> interesting in this section is how it's shaped overall.  There's a lot of dissonance kind of sitting around, but the dissonance is in thirds so it doesn't sound dissonant even though it doesn't match the chord that the bass implies.  Oh, and look at the end of measure 8 all the way into measure 10.  There are two separate things going on!  There's one on the strong beats that goes C# E, B D, A C, E# B, F# A, and there's one on the weak beats a fourth below that goes G B, F# A, E G, F# A.  That last F# A is where both join up again.  This single melody composed of two separate lines is called a <em>compound melody</em>.  In measure 9 beat 1, both halves of the compound melody are passing tones, the B and D are (accented) passing tones between the Ce and E of the previous measure and the A and C#, and the F# and A are passing tones between the G and B of the previous measure and the E and G.  This shows that we <em>can</em> take a longer view on non-harmonic tones.  The F# and A are technically between the B and D and the A and C#, but we can think of it as part of a separate voice not related to those two dyads.  At the same time, there's that dissonance sitting around.  That's because the four voices in the soprano and alto are not quite synchronized with the bass, even though they're working towards the same goal of resolving to the tonic at measure 10.  The downbeat of measure 9 is especially dissonant, with a C#, a B, and a D all at the same time.  The C# and D form a minor ninth (well, plus an octave), an extremely harsh dissonance.  Not to mention that the F# in the second voice is also dissonant.  But that C# in the bass resolves to D in the next measure, and the B and D come down eventually to F# and A.  Everything resolves in measure 10.</p>
<p class="text">Another point of interest in the non-harmonic tones is in measure 5.  There's a kind of similar thing going on to measure 3, except that now the strong beat (the D) is consonant.  If you ignore the grace note E, the C# is clearly an incomplete lower neighbor.  If you ignore the C#, the grace note E is a passing tone, but with the C#, it's an incomplete neighbor tone.  Honestly, it doesn't matter what you call it.  That rhythm and contour is the same as in measure 9, and in that measure we kept track of passing tones in a compound melody.  We could think of the F# - E - D and C# - B as two parts of a compound melody as well.  Or we could not.  If we don't, then the C# and E actually become incomplete changing tones, which is pretty cool.  If you consider the D in measure 4 more structurally important than the F# at measure 5, then they aren't even incomplete.  This shows that how you label the non-harmonic tones can sometimes be very context-dependent, but it's not difficult to see that they still <em>are</em> non-harmonic tones.  One of the nice things about analyzing Bach chorales is that those ambiguities go away.  One of the non-nice things about analyzing Bach chorales is that they're boring.  It's a give and take.</p>
<p class="text">A final note on non-harmonic tones in this piece: still in measure 5, the last eighth note has that chromatic E# in the alto.  Despite the second eighth note of beat 2 being a weak beat, that beat is given emphasis in this measure by the D# in the bass that implies a changing chord.  That makes the E# an accented neighbor tone (an appoggiatura), kinda, but it's still rhythmically weak enough that I wouldn't go that far.  But it is a rhythmic diminution of the descending step motif.  When we deal with intervals, an inverted interval has the bass moved above the other note, a diminished interval is narrower than a minor/perfect interval, and an augmented interval is wider than a major/perfect interval.  Well, with melodies and motifs, all three words have completely different meanings.  An inverted melody is upside-down, a diminished melody is played faster, and an augmented melody is played slower.  The alto E# - F# in measure 5 is both inverted from the descending eighth note motif and rhythmically diminished.</p>
<h4 class="question">That is confusing!</h4>
<p class="text">Sure is!</p>
<p class="text">Before we move on, I want to briefly mention the harmonies.  We haven't studied Roman numeral notation in depth yet, and we will, but there are a few interesting things we don't see often that I want to point out.  In measure 5, the V6/ii is a passing chord.  It's quick, it's not structural, and it doesn't even resolve to the ii it's normally supposed to resolve to, going instead to V43 in an irregular resolution.  It's not <em>very</em> irregular, since the ii and V43 chords have two notes in common.  We would expect that this phrase would be generally shaped like I - ii - V - I, but it's actually just I - V - I, with the ii only teased by that V6/ii and the bass at measure 6.  In measure 11 we have a weird chord with a weird resolution: a Ger43.  We'll talk about augmented 6th chords and how they work; long story short, they don't work <em>this</em> way.  Used here, it's a neighbor chord to the i chords on either side.  You could even consider the E# and G to be neighbor tones of the F#'s in measure 12.  They appear late rather than on the downbeat due to compound melody effects in both soprano and bass, and the voices get a bit confused around there because of the sudden change of texture.  That Ger43 is at the very least a neighbor <em>chord</em>.  In 14 and 15, we get more passing chords.  The viiø43 might not even be a chord, since it's just a result of the G# being there as a passing tone from the F# to the A, but since the D and G# resolve like a tritone to the C# and A, it makes sense to consider it its own chord.  Much more interesting — and weirder — is the viio6/vii.  That's just not a chord that shows up, ever.  Well, what's happening is that all three voices have incomplete lower neighbor tones to the viio6 that follows.  Since those lower neighbor tones "resolve" to viio6 like a viio6 resolves to a I6, I labeled it a viio6/vii.  It would be a mistake to read that as tonicizing a diminished chord; the chord is really just a bunch of non-harmonic tones played at the same time!  This is also a passing chord.  There are two kinds of non-structural chords, passing chords, which connect different chords, and neighbor chords, which return to the same chord.  It's not in perfect analogy to the non-harmonic tones.</p>
<p class="text">Lastly — actually lastly — I want to point out that these two phrases (the first phrase is bars 3-10; the second is 11-18) follow a fairly common pattern: the first phrase is a simple phrase model, T - D - T, while the second phrase is more complicated and ends on the dominant.  Common Practice music <em>loves</em> to modulate to the dominant, and it usually stays there.  Albeniz doesn't — the very next bar goes back to the D major material in measure 3, which gets developed.  But if this were Mozart, he'd probably stay in A for a while.</p>

<h3 class="subsection-title" id="suspensions">9.2.3 Suspensions</h3>

<p class="text">Suspensions are a bit special because they have well-recognized types.  You'll often hear talk of a 4-3 suspension or whatever.  The following are the common suspensions in Common Practice music:</p>

<? createExample('suspensions'); ?>

<p class="text">These suspensions aren't really suspensions, since a real suspension has a preparation — the note has to be held from the previous chord — and these don't.  But they still represent the types of suspensions commonly used.  The first is the most common, the 4-3 suspension, so named because one of the voices is on the 4 and resolves to the 3.  Accented non-harmonic tones like suspensions, appoggiaturas, accented passing tones, and retardations tend to work best when the note they resolve to is <em>not</em> already in the chord, so you can see that in this example, the chord doesn't have a third until the fourth resolves to it.  The suspension is called 4-3, but it can also be #4-3 (say, B to A over an F chord) or 4-b3 (G to F over a Dm chord).  #4-b3 is not considered a proper resolution since augmented seconds don't usually count as steps, but that doesn't have to stop you from using it if you think it works in your music.  If you're in C minor, there's a legitimate case for a suspended B resolving to Ab in an Fm chord, the iv.  Common Practice music wouldn't do this, but <em>you</em> don't need to write Common Practice music, right?</p>
<p class="text">The next one is actually not that popular: the 6-5.  The problem is that the 6 isn't actually dissonant.  You need both the 6 and the 5 for dissonance to happen.  However, the 6-5 suspension happens often <em>melodically</em>, where it's usually a double suspension.  Check out the cadential 64 chord in measure 6.  There's a 4-3 suspension <em>and</em> a 6-5 suspension at the same time!  The effect is that the chord sounds like a second inversion triad.  Some analyze it as I did: the chord in measure 6 <em>looks</em> like a C major chord in second inversion, a I64, but <em>really</em> it's a G major chord, V, that has two chord members suspended.  I see the point, but I don't like this analysis.  I prefer to just call it a I64 and treat the suspensions as harmonic.  But I want to present how some others see it.  The 6-5 suspension can also be b6-5, but that's about the only alteration that makes sense.  Altering the 5 doesn't work (generally) because the resolution should be a consonant tone, not a dissonant one.</p>
<p class="text">The 9-8 is quite popular.  In this one as in the 6-5, usually the resolution of the suspension is already in the chord, unlike with the 4-3.  Again, 9-8 could certainly be b9-8, but not really anything else.  In pop music, the 2 actually resolves up to the 3, but Common Practice theory has a predilection for resolving stuff down a step instead of up (in a retardation), so while you certainly <em>could</em> go up, Common Practice music doesn't have a name for it.  It's 9-8 because we're looking at notes above the bass, and if it were 2-1, the 1 wouldn't be above the bass.  We call it a 9 because it goes down to the 8.</p>
<h4 class="question">Does this have anything to do with chord extensions in jazz?</h4>
<p class="text">It does not.  In jazz, harmonies are extended by stacking thirds; here, the 9th isn't a part of an extended harmony; it's just not part of the harmony at all, which is why it needs resolution.</p>
<p class="text">The next one is probably less familiar: the 7-6.  When is the 6 a consonance?  In first-inversion chords, right?  So this is <em>actually</em> a 9-8 suspension in a first-inversion chord.  The equivalent of the 6-5 suspension sounds weird in a first-inversion chord, but it could be used; it would be called 4-3 in that case.</p>
<p class="text">Then, finally, the 2-3 suspension.</p>
<h4 class="question">Didn't you <em>just</em> say that the 2-3 suspension is a retardation instead and doesn't have a name?</h4>
<p class="text">Ah, right.  Yeah.  But this is completely different: it's actually a 4-3 suspension <em>in the bass</em>.  It looks like the suspended tone goes up, but actually, the bass moves down instead, so the note that was a 2 above the bass is now a 3 above the bass.  Along with that, we usually also mention the other note in the chord, which is a 5 above the first bass note and a 6 above the second.  We end up analyzing the 2-3 suspension as 52 - 63.</p>
<p class="text">Now, I personally don't believe in the 7-6 and 2-3 suspensions.  I don't mean that I don't believe that they have what it takes to win the championship; I mean that I don't believe they exist.  It makes more sense to think of suspensions relative to the root of the chord, not to the bass, which means you can suspend to the three chord tones, the 1 (9-8 suspension), the 3 (4-3 suspension), and the 5 (6-5 suspension).</p>
<p class="text">The most glorious example of the 4-3 suspension that I know of is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSgKzZor7k0">To Far Away Times</a> by Yasunori Mitsuda, from Chrono Trigger.  I transcribed the first third of it or so (in part by listening and in part by looking at MIDIs at <a href="https://vgmusic.com/">vgmusic.com</a>); you get the long intro and the first statement of the theme (also re-synthesized for your pleasure):</p>

<? createExample('To Far Away Times'); ?>

<p class="text">To Far Away Times is a radical change in genre.  The Chrono Trigger soundtrack is diverse, but this song is probably the closest thing it has to pop music.  We can immediately see from the score the kind of ensemble that Mitsuda envisioned: since everything is synthesized anyway, it doesn't have to resemble extremely real instruments, but the instrumentation is still sparse.  It doesn't need to have a lot of parts.  Here, we get just a bass, a treble (which I took to be a marimba at first, but one of the MIDIs suggested a harp and I thought that fit better given the harp-like runs that show up later in the piece), some strings, a glock (it might actually be a piano, but I like the glockenspiel sound), and a piccolo (could be a flute playing high, but I don't care), along with some percussion.  To me, the sound was similar to a cabasa, which consists of a bunch of rings of metal beads around a ridged metal surface; you slide the rings a bit and it creates a kind of scraping sound.  It's impractical to play that fast on a cabasa, so maybe the intended effect is metal brushes on a snare drum, or maybe even an egg shaker (a small rattle) or a sand block (two paddles covered in sandpaper).  Whatever, I used the cabasa.  More instruments come in later in the song, but the old ones step out.  The SNES sound chip could only handle so many sounds at once, I'm not sure how many, so it's useful to cycle instruments out if you bring new ones in.  The harp and glock are also echoed 3/4 of a beat behind; the MIDIs I looked at used separate tracks for that echo effect.  Just as a notational comment, the bass sounds one octave lower than written, the glock sounds two octaves higher than written, and the piccolo sounds one octave higher than written.  I wrote in little reminders.</p>
<p class="text">So, what's going on here in terms of non-harmonic tones?  Quite a bit.  The perfect fourth is one of the prevalent motifs in the game, as are quartal chords (like E A D G) and sus chords.  To Far Away Times, as the ending theme, has to resolve those dissonant fourths that were built up from the moment you turned on the game for the first time.  Here, listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXGi7pqxsgk">A Premonition</a>, which plays in the first 30 seconds of turning the game on.  There are three chords, all of them sus chords (the second chord uses a third in the figuration, but not in the strings), giving it a mysterious and unresolved feeling.  The intro to To Far Away Times has a similar figuration (it's melodically inverted and it's in 4/4 instead of 6/8, but it's similar), but here it actually resolves.  AFTER 16 MEASURES.</p>
<h4 class="question">You mean 12 measures?</h4>
<p class="text">The first four bars repeat, so it's 16 in total.  Just look at the structure: just the drums, bass, and figuration for four bars, and they continue with a crescendo for four more bars.  The strings layer on top with a chord for four more bars, then the glock (or piano) comes in with a melody and everyone gets softer to let the melody come out, but still, it's the same chord, the same figuration.  The tension gets ratcheted up a bit at bar 11, when the dissonant Gb in the strings moves up an octave.  It's only in bar 13 that things change, when the held Gb <em>finally</em> releases to the F, and the figuration becomes more... normal, I guess, with triads and scales.  The second half of bar 14, the bass finally changes, and we're off to the races (or Guardia's Millennial Fair, I guess).</p>
<h4 class="question">Hey, I got that reference!  Back in <? sectionLinkShort('sound intervals P4'); ?> you told me to play Chrono Trigger.  You weren't kidding; man, that's an amazing game.</h4>
<p class="text">Yes!  I told you!  The thing is, despite 17 and a half measures of static harmony (the 4-3 resolution doesn't count as a change in harmony, since the 4 was a non-harmonic tone), To Far Away Times's harmony <em>is not static</em>.  There's a fairly normal harmonic progression.  It just takes a very long time to <em>start</em>.</p>
<p class="text">So, going from the start of the song, the figuration is essentially a compound melody.  Anytime you have shifting arpeggios like you do here, there's a compound melody in the arpeggios.  I interpret the Eb as an appoggiatura that eventually resolves to Db as a 9-8 suspension, and I treat the Gb as the 4-3 appoggiatura we've been talking about (which later shows up in the strings).  The more interesting bit here is the Cb.  We have the notes Db Eb Gb Ab Cb, which form the "dorian" pentatonic scale on Db, the one that goes 1 2 4 5 b7.  In pop terms, it's a Db9sus chord, but I'm calling the Eb and Gb non-harmonic.  This is not without controversy, but since they do eventually resolve, I'm treating the sound of these notes as part of the <em>macroharmony</em> instead of the chord.  The Cb, however, is interesting, because Common Practice music doesn't generally leap to a dissonance like that without immediately resolving it.  The Cb <em>does</em> resolve, however — to Bb, which is not in the chord either.  The Cb therefore is a secondary neighbor tone, as the neighbor of a neighbor.  If you think of the Cb as structural, then the Bb is a passing tone between the Cb and the Ab, but if you don't, then the Bb is a neighbor of the Ab.  In measure 4, the Cb is now going up to the Db, so it's a lower neighbor.  (It's actually an incomplete neighbor but I didn't bother marking that.)  In measure 5, the Gb comes in the strings with no preparation, so it's an appoggiatura (remember, suspensions are always prepared by being held from a previous chord).</p>
<p class="text">In measure 9 we get the intro melody (the real melody begins at 19).  Pretty much all melodies are full of non-harmonic tones, no matter what genre you're in.  The Eb at 10 is interesting, because it's a passing tone to the F at 13, not to the next note.  The Gb is an appoggiatura, but interestingly enough, it's preceded by an anticipation.  This anticipation is melodic rather than harmonic, since its resolution is not consonant, but the rhythm in measure 10 becomes a rhythmic motif used again at measure 12 to finally arrive at the F that we've been suspending all this time.  The rest of the intro proceeds in a fairly standard manner, including in the figuration.  One weird bit is the vii chord, which is not diatonic (the diatonic chord would be viio, not vii).  This is a passing chord between the I and vi7.  Notice that in measures 14 and 15, the lower string voice goes Ab - G - F while the bass goes Db - C - Bb, a fifth lower (plus some octaves, but whatever).  These fifths moving together are called <em>parallel fifths</em>.  It's generally a good idea to avoid them, but that depends heavily on the texture.  The idea that parallel fifths should <em>always</em> be avoided is one of the reasons <? sectionLinkShort('zero', 'Rule 0'); ?> exists!  Mitsuda makes frequent use of parallel fifths here, and it's completely OK.</p>
<p class="text">At 15, there's something interesting: a vi7 chord.  In Common Practice music, non-dominant 7ths are dissonant, but in jazz, they're not.  Chrono Trigger borrows heavily from jazz harmonic idioms, not so much in this song but in plenty of others.  But Mitsuda, in using those dissonant notes, actually creates something polychordal.  The upper string part goes F - Ab - Db, and the figuration has Db - Ab a few times, heavily emphasizing the Db major chord that is <em>not</em> sounding because the chord is Bbm.  The Ab doesn't resolve like a dissonant note does.  That's why I'm suggesting that it's a pedal.  We'll talk about those soon.  The chord changes further at 17 to a ii65, but you see the Ab pedal still going strong despite it not being in the chord.  The upper strings are still outlining a Db major chord even though the harmony has changed.  You could think of the Ab as a harmonic 11th in the ii65 chord (it would be a ninth above the bass, but the root is not the bass in this chord).  The F is similarly weird as a non-harmonic tone, since it's not treated as dissonant.  When measure 18 arrives, the Ab is now the root of the chord, and since it's in the strings, it's no longer prominent in the figuration in the harp, but instead the Db is introduced as an anticipation of the resolution at 19.  Note the middle string voice, which has an actual 4-3 suspension: the Db is held over from the previous chord and resolves to C.  This string voice is doubling the melody an octave lower (remember, the glock sounds two octaves higher than written), but the Db there isn't held over, so it's an appoggiatura rather than a suspension.  Or an accented passing tone, if you ignore the Bb.</p>
<p class="text">At 19, we finally have the theme!  This part is more like the rest of the game: the first chord has a sus chord that doesn't resolve, and 20 has a chord that's not used in Common Practice music, a quartal chord, that breaks Roman numeral analysis.  For the unresolved dissonance, we could still consider it a non-harmonic tone, but it's not a named one because those all resolve.  It's clearly still a I chord (look at the figuration and the bass).  In jazz-based modern music, chord extensions and alterations are often used for color, meaning that Yasunori Mitsuda likes the sound of the Dbsus4 right there.  However, leaving chords unresolved is also a compositional technique; you make the listeners expect something and you <em>don't give it to them</em>.  "Here, you want this resolution?  Tough, you can't have it."  Mahler did it at the end of his 9th symphony, and then he died.  That piece has a very famous ending to which a video just can't do justice.</p>
<p class="text">The chord at 20 is interesting.  The bass is F, and it has a Bb that doesn't appear to be resolving anywhere.  The melody has an Eb and an Ab, none of which are treated as dissonances.  So what's going on?  Well, these notes spell out F Bb Eb Ab, a four-note chord by fourths — a <em>quartal</em> chord.  Quartal chords don't have simple names and Roman numeral notation was invented to deal with tertian chords (stacks of thirds), not quartal chords, so iii74 is the closest I could get.  Quartal chords frequently serve as something like a dominant or pre-dominant; there's a lot of tension because of the fourths but not a whole lot of direction, and fourths sound clean so it's not very discordant either.  Tritones are harsh, but perfect fourths are the opposite.  The chord therefore moves on the strength of the <em>melodic</em> relationships present.  The F wants to go up to Gb, and the Ab wants to resolve down to Gb.  So we get a nice IV chord at 21, with an honest-to-goodness suspension (even though it's restruck) in the melody.  This one's a 9-8, since the Ab is a ninth above the bass of the Gb major chord, and it resolves down to the Gb, the octave.  But the rest of the measure is polychordal, implying a Db major triad while the harmony is clearly Gb.  The Db is in the chord, but the F and lower Ab are not, and neither is treated as a dissonance.  I wouldn't call it a Gb9 chord because the F and Ab are not heard in relation to the Gb root but to the Db in the melody; that's why I say that there's something polychordal going on here.  Measure 22 has nothing particularly interesting going on except the parallel fifths in the strings, which I don't care about and you shouldn't care about either.</p>
<p class="text">23 has that vi7 again.  Chrono Trigger has m7 chords.  That's a thing the game does.  It's cool.  The retardation in the melody is not particularly interesting.  By the way, remember At the Bottom of the Night in <? exampleLink('At the Bottom of the Night'); ?>?  The syncopated bit in 22 is used there too, as are the m7 chords!  Like I've said, Chrono Trigger is <em>unified</em>.  24 has a 9th chord, a real 9th chord, which you don't see often in Common Practice music.  The F is dissonant, but not within the chord; it resolves to the Eb in the next chord.  At 25, the Db in the strings is a textbook 4-3 suspension, held over from the previous chord and resolved, but the Db in the figuration does not have the preparation and therefore it's an appoggiatura, which resolves to the C at 26.</p>
<p class="text">Second time through the theme is identical until pickups to 32.  That pickup Bb <em>looks</em> like an escape tone, but it's actually consonant!  The chord is a Bbm7, so the Bb is clearly in the chord.  At 32 we get an interesting suspension.  The Ab in the strings is <em>prepared</em> like a suspension, but it doesn't resolve like one.  What gives?  Well, you see, it makes more sense to think of the Ab as resolving up an octave to the G in the next chord instead of to the Bb.  There's some part crossing going on.  The Ab is still a 4-3 suspension; the resolution simply happens in a different voice.  The last two bars are also a 4-3 suspension.</p>
<p class="text">It's remarkable how <em>unresolved</em> 4-3's — so, sus chords and quartal chords — are used as motifs throughout the game, but here in the ending theme, we get to hear resolved 4-3's.  Of course, that's an oversimplification.  Resolving a 4-3 in a V chord is par for the course.  A cadential 64 is nothing more than a resolved 4-3 suspension in a V chord that happens to have a 6-5 partner (and possibly an 8-7, but that's harmonic).  Chrono Trigger depends on <em>functioning</em> V chords, which need to have thirds.  It's the tonic chords that stay unresolved, and when they do resolve, they quickly move to other chords.  Try giving the whole soundtrack a listen and see if you can pick out unresolved sus chords, m9 chords, etc.</p>
<h4 class="question">You want me to listen to the whole thing?  It's, like, hours long.</h4>
<p class="text">Oh, come on, it's Chrono Trigger.  Is whatever else you were going to do actually better than Chrono Trigger.</p>
<h4 class="question">I was gonna play La-Mulana.</h4>
<p class="text">...You know, maybe Chrono Trigger's OST can wait.  Carry on; I'll be here when you're done!</p>

<h3 class="subsection-title" id="pedal-points">9.2.4 Pedal Points</h3>

<p class="text">The pedal point is a different kind of non-harmonic tone from the others we've seen so far.  A <em>pedal point</em>, or simply a <em>pedal</em>, is a note that's held over several chord changes.  The name refers to organ pedals, since in organ music the note held is often a bass note, played by the pedals, but the note could be in any register.  The note is treated as if it's just not there by the harmony, except when it starts and stops, at which points it's treated normally.  The pedal tone can be any note, but most often it's the dominant in the middle of a piece and the tonic at the end.  I've written pedal points myself, but for the best examples I think we're going to have to go Bach to back.  I mean, back to Bach.  Here's a great example I found, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5D8b9j4URY">Prelude 12 in F minor</a> from the Well-Tempered Clavier, Book I:</p>

<? createExample('Prelude 12 Book I'); ?>

<h4 class="question">Huh, um, your recording isn't played on a piano.  This is a piano piece, no?  The video plays the piano.  Also it's slower.  Why isn't yours slower?  And the style is different.</h4>
<p class="text">You're right that it's meant for keyboard, but it's not necessarily a piano.  Could be an organ or harpsichord.  In fact, given the lack of dynamic markings in much of Bach's work, I don't think he was writing for piano specifically (it was invented during his lifetime, though).  In any case, I don't personally see a reason that it has to be played on a keyboard, since the Well-Tempered Clavier in general doesn't depend on the sound of the piano.  Some of the pieces benefit from it, but we're talking about pedal points, and the piano is <em>bad</em> at pedal points because the notes can't be held indefinitely.  This piece features two pedal points, one at the start and one at the end, and I chose to synthesize it using brass in order to carry that sound through.  The alto voice is actually a flügelhorn sound because some parts were too high for the regular horn, except at the end where I needed the power of the horn, so the alto voice switches sound in the last few measures.  As for the tempo, the Dover edition suggests quarter = 56 so I did quarter = 56.  Kimiko Ishizaka in the video above chose a slower tempo and more detached articulations for some of the 16th notes, and that's her performance decision.  Part of the beauty of Bach's music is that he doesn't specify everything, which means that the performer has considerable leeway to interpret it as he or she sees fit.  In addition to the instrumental change, I also added dynamics, which Ishizaka also did; these dynamics, again, are my personal sense of how I feel the piece should sound.  You may have a completely different idea for how this piece should go.  You may even want to play it twice as fast.  That's up to you!</p>
<p class="text">The Bach chorales are very strict about being for four voices; four people could theoretically sing each one (but sometimes they go really low for the basses).  His keyboard music, on the other hand, is not so strict.  The edition I transcribed sometimes leaves the voices ambiguous; I had to mess around with it a bit to make it fit into four voices.  The fugues tend to be better than the preludes, but sometimes a bass voice will disappear and a new soprano voice will enter, which is fine on a keyboard but isn't so great if it's played by instruments!  One time when Bach very often violates the conservation of voices is at the very end of his pieces, and this prelude is an example.  In the last beat or so before the final chord, a fifth voice enters.  That's perfectly normal.</p>
<p class="text">The Well-Tempered Clavier consists of two Books, each of which contains 24 pairs of a prelude and a fugue, one pair in each major and minor key.  Prelude and Fugue 12 are in F major.  The fugues... are fugues.  There's not much to say about them.  But the preludes are more free-form.  I have to say that I like the fugues better; they tend to be more interesting and more fun.  The preludes, though, are not without charm.  The main way to describe the preludes is that they generally contain the exploration of just one musical idea, and some are polyphonic and some are not.  This one happens to be in four voices, but some have block chords instead of separate voices; some have two voices or three or five.  This particular prelude is written using <em>imitative counterpoint</em>, which is where different voices have similar material at different times.  If you look at the first two beats in the soprano at measure 1 and the last two beats of measure 2 in the tenor, you can see that they're identical except in different octaves.  Measure 3 beat 3, the tenor has that again, but at a different pitch level.  Measure 4 beat 3 tenor, different accidentals.  And so on.  Measure 4 beat 1 soprano is a similar figure; measure 5 beat 1 alto, that similar figure is transposed down.  These motifs keep coming back over and over, a key feature of imitative counterpoint.  So when we talk about the non-harmonic tones, we're not going to bother discussing every single one, because most of them result from the same figurations.</p>
<h4 class="question">What about the pedal points?</h4>
<p class="text">Ah, yeah, those.  So, there are two examples here, one at the start and one at the end.  Both pedals happen to be in the bass.  When we notate bass pedals, we generally don't bother with inversions unless it's important; the pedal can be denoted by simply writing "PED" with a horizontal line for the duration of the pedal.  At the beginning, the pedal is on F, which is the tonic (we're in F minor), so we call it a <em>tonic pedal</em>.  Pedals are not necessarily non-harmonic, but in this case, the pedal is non-harmonic at two chords, the viio in measure 1 beat 2 and the viio7 in measure 2 beat 2.  Notice that the chord at measure 2 beat 2 is E G Bb Db, an Edim7 chord. and it very much should not have an F!  The F is extremely dissonant against this already very dissonant chord.  But we don't really hear the F as part of the chord, since it's a pedal tone.  The other pedal begins at measure 17 and lasts four measures, on a C, which is the dominant in F minor, so this is a <em>dominant pedal</em>.  Again, some of the chords contain the C and some don't, but the C doesn't care; it just keeps going.</p>
<h4 class="question">Now, I thought you said that tonic pedals come at the end of the piece and dominant pedals come in the middle?  This is backwards.</h4>
<p class="text">What can I say, Bach is creative!  Pedals can serve many functions.  At the end of a piece, a pedal is often used to draw out a coda.  You do that last big cadence, and then you noodle around on the tonic as you make the listener wait for the piece to end.  In this case, Bach isn't making you wait for the coda to <em>end</em>; he's making you wait for it to <em>start</em>!  The noodling around on the dominant is just going on and on and on, making it more satisfying when it does finally arrive on I at the last chord.</p>
<h4 class="question">Why is the last chord F major?  Shouldn't it be F minor?</h4>
<p class="text">It's called a <em>Picardy third</em>.  Pieces in minor, especially those more influenced by the music of the Renaissance, tend to end on a major tonic instead of a minor tonic, and the third of the chord is known as the Picardy third when this happens.  We'll discuss it more in a few sections.</p>
<p class="text">The tonic pedal at the beginning serves a very different function from the one at the end.  Here, the tonic is providing a grounding for the exposition of the main motif of the prelude.  The pedal is ensuring that the piece isn't going anywhere just yet, while also keeping you from focusing too much on the parts that aren't important, like the alto and tenor, and imparting some pathos with the dissonance.  You can hear in the video how the effect is wasted when the pedal is played with a piano versus an instrument capable of sustaining pitch like the tuba.  The most dissonant moment is measure 2 beat 2, when the alto holds an E natural.  Other instances of the E natural were momentary, but this one is accented.  By having this here, Bach establishes the mood of the piece without needing more intractable dissonance later.</p>
<p class="text">These two pedals resolve in different ways.  While a pedal doesn't need to be non-harmonic, it still creates melodic tension by being a note that's not moving while others are.  Tonic pedals generally resolve by the harmony simply going back to the tonic.  That's what happens here, where measure 2 beat 3 sees a i chord at the tail end of the pedal that moves on as if nothing had happened.  Dominant pedals, on the other hand, tend to resolve to the tonic fairly dramatically, as the one in this prelude does.</p>
<h4 class="question">Can you have pedals on other notes?</h4>
<p class="text">Of course you can!  We'll look at some shortly.  First, though, let's see what we can learn about the rest of this piece.  Firstly, notice the hints of compound melody, which you can see right at the start in the soprano.  The high F might as well have been held over to the next beat, forming a suspension, but instead, it's restruck in beat 2.  Calling it a suspension is a <em>bit</em> weird, though, because suspensions generally happen on the strong beat, and this one... well, I guess it kinda does?  You <em>feel</em> the F being held at the downbeat of beat 2, but it's not actually there.  When the F shows up a 16th note later, it feels like it had been there all along, and that's why I'm calling it a suspension.  The F is consonant with the first chord but not with the second, so it resolves to the E natural; you get preparation, suspension, and resolution.  It's the same note as the pedal F, too, but by the second chord, the pedal is in the background.</p>
<h4 class="question">What kind of suspension is it?  Like, what scale degrees?  It's weird...</h4>
<p class="text">It's very weird.  If you interpret the chord as a viio, it's a 9-8, but 9-8 above what?  There's no bass.  If you think of it as a viio64, with the tenor Bb in the bass, it's 5-4.  ACtually, 5-#4.  That goes from consonant to dissonant, so <em>that's</em> weird.  I think the most productive way of looking at it is as a 4-3 over a V7 chord that's missing its root, but a bar later we see how the same figure in the tenor, and there, the bass is G, making this a 7-6 suspension.</p>
<h4 class="question">Which one did Bach intend?</h4>
<p class="text">Most of the music theory we study today was formulated in the 19th century, which was long after Bach's time.  He would probably have written it in figured bass notation as 842, with the 8 going to natural 7, since the bass is F and the E is chromatically altered, but I find it a stretch to think that he was thinking about suspensions in terms of figured bass notation.  I'm sure he did mean it as a suspension, but there was no reason for him to get more specific.  That specificity is useful to <em>us</em> in analysis, but not to him in composition.</p>
<p class="text">Moving on, in the second measure we have something that shows up throughout the piece: the b9 in a dominant 7th chord.  I'm not talking about the suspended Ab in the alto; that's the same kind of thing as we saw in measure 1, where the Ab is carried over from the previous chord.  I'm talking about the Db.  The b9 straddles the line between harmonic and non-harmonic.  It sometimes resolves as a non-harmonic tone and sometimes not.  Note that it's definitely <em>dissonant</em>.  In measure 2 beat 2, I analyzed the chord as a viio7, meaning that the Db makes a d7 interval with the E natural that's ostensibly the root.  But I don't think the C is heard as particularly dissonant, so even though I marked it as a passing tone, I could hear this as a V7b9 over the tonic pedal.  This ambiguity is purely analytical; Bach wasn't trying to confuse us.  If we simply think of the chord as a 9th chord, everything still works.</p>
<p class="text">In measure 2, in the bass, we have F G Ab Bb C Db, which then goes on to E, then F Gb A, and eventually Bb, C Db, eventually Eb, and it finally lands on Ab in measure 6.  There are two things I want to point out about this scalar line.  The first is that in measure 3, the Bb goes <em>down</em> to the C rather than up.  This is a kind of <em>octave displacement</em>, when a melody that would normally have a note in one octave has the note in a different octave instead.  In this case, it's done for range considerations; the higher C would collide with the alto and not leave room for the tenor melody.  But if you look at that tenor melody, measure 3 beat 3 goes C E G C Db C Bb Db, but with that first Db a major 7th below the C's around it.  This is also octave displacement, and it serves to make the compound melody more obvious as well as maintain the C as the high point so far.  The second thing I want to point out is that from measure 3 to measure 4 we have Db to E natural, and from measure 4 to measure 5 we have Gb to A natural.  These are augmented seconds!  You won't see <em>these</em> in Bach's chorales!  Augmented seconds are often awkward in voice leading, as well as hard to sing.  Generally they're treated as a leap rather than a step.  There's a bit of an excuse here: the Db is part of the same chord as the E natural, so it could count as a chordal leap.  In any case, consonant leaps of augmented seconds are rare in Bach's music; most of the time, he hides the augmented second by having one voice do the first note of the interval and another voice do the second.  On piano, you can't really tell the difference anyway, so it's clearly an academic distinction.</p>
<p class="text">Measure 5 in the alto, there's an interesting variation on the opening motif.  That low note back in measure 1 beat 2 is missing, and instead, the suspended note is <em>actually</em> a suspension.  But it doesn't resolve right away.  It gets restruck first.  The soprano echoes that resolution in beat 3, and the alto has it again in measure 6 beat 2.  The soprano takes off with the suspensions in an <em>almost</em>-sequence starting in measure 6 beat 3.  A sequence is when material is repeated exactly at a higher or lower pitch value in a pattern, and this almost happens here.  The bass, alto, and soprano spend four beats doing exactly the same thing in every beat, except up a step each time.  The tenor has the main motif, which is repeated three times, except that measure 7 beat 1 has an Ab instead of a G, which would have made the sequence perfect.  The Dover edition actually suggests the G there as an alternative way to play this passage, but I followed the main text.  In the video above, Ishizaka plays the same thing I did, but the sheet music in the video has the G rather than the Ab.  I think it's more interesting as an almost-sequence, personally.  Bach loves sequences in general, and he usually has two repetitions before doing something else.  In this case, after two repetitions, the bass and tenor keep going for a third while the alto and soprano do something else to transition out.</p>
<p class="text">Measure 10 beat 1 has an example of a suspension with delayed resolution in the soprano.  The G is a dissonant suspension — it's prepared by being held from the previous chord — but it resolves... down by leap to C?  No.  It resolves to F.  It just goes to C first.  This is fairly common; it's just a suspension with some embellishment of its own.  Measure 13 also has some suspension shenanigans, because things don't resolve when you'd expect them to.  The Db in the soprano on beat 3 is suspended when we hit the V chord on beat 4, and it should resolve down to C.  Which it does an eighth note later, but that's a new chord already.  The suspension does resolve, but it does so at a chord change.  The E natural in the alto on beat 4 does something similar, but it creates an interesting augmented fifth with the Ab in the tenor.  It clearly needs to resolve up to F, which it does in the next bar, but the chord on the second half of beat 4 is left up in the air.  I think there's an argument for calling it a bIII+6, but given how dissonant the E natural is, I think it makes more sense as a non-harmonic tone.  You're obviously free to disagree.</p>
<p class="text">Measure 14 does something cool that's fairly common in Bach's minor music: the raised 6th of the melodic minor scale.  Most of the time, it only shows up melodically as a passing tone, but here it's harmonized with its own IV6 chord.  If you look at some of Bach's... sharper works, like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1bMc12pC88">D#m fugue from the Well-Tempered Clavier Book I</a>, this leads to lots of double sharps, but here we just have D natural and E natural.  Still, the use of a major IV6 chord is fairly uncommon.  You're probably familiar with the kind of ethereal magic of the IV chord in major from listening to pieces in dorian, but Bach is very deliberately avoiding that effect: the chord only lasts for an eighth note and it's clearly a passing sonority between the V in 13 beat 4 and the i in 14 beat 2, along with the i64 that precedes it and the viio that follows.  That viio is similarly rare: diminished triads are almost never in root position!  The only exceptions are when it's required by a sequence or a scalar line in the bass; here it's obviously the latter, since we go Bb C D E F.</p>
<p class="text">Some funky stuff happens at 15 and 16.  15 has an interesting trading off happening in the soprano and alto, where together they cover every 16th note in the bar, but each voice only has some of them.  Bach does this all the time.  On the piano it's frankly not that interesting, even though the held notes do give the feeling of two lines going on at once, but with two instruments the effect is stronger, and it serves to add tension.  We're building up to a climax here!  At the same time, the bass on beat 3 of measure 15 has the main motif, but inverted.  The suspension becomes a retardation, since suspensions resolve down and this one resolves up.  It's not an exact match, but it's close enough for you to be able to tell what it's supposed to be.  Then, at 16 beat 1, the tenor has an augmented second again, but this time it's not so easy to excuse.</p>
<h4 class="question">Why does Bach need an excuse?  He's J. S. Fucking Bach, the master of all that is music.  He doesn't make excuses!</h4>
<p class="text">I mean... yeah.  Fair enough.  He doesn't.  But they're both non-harmonic passing tones, and the Ab is actually really dissonant, since the alto is holding an E natural at that moment.  I think what he's doing here is treating the B natural as an incomplete chromatic lower neighbor to the C, and the Ab is actually the harmonic tone here, with the G another incomplete lower neighbor.  But the soprano and alto don't <em>exactly</em> support this interpretation, except that it's very similar to what happens at the end of bar 13.  Measure 16 is actually very unusual, because we get a bVI7, a major 7th chord on scale degree b6.  The C is dissonant against the Db, but the soprano clearly doesn't care.  That's OK, because the tenor resolves that dissonance in the next chord, but Bach doesn't write a whole lot of M7 chords.</p>
<h4 class="question">M7 chords are so common, though.</h4>
<p class="text">Yes — in <em>jazz</em>.  To Baroque ears, the major 7th interval was dissonant, not jazzy; it always needed to be resolved, generally downward (by step).  The minor and diminished 7th had the same tendencies.  In modern music, the major 7th doesn't need any resolution, while the minor 7th can go up or down (but it also doesn't need a resolution).  The diminished 7th still really ought to go down, but obviously you can make it go wherever you damn well please.</p>
<p class="text">At measure 17 we finally get to the pedal.  That's a big arrival.  The soprano has a melody similar to the very start of the piece; the tenor has quarter notes and the bass has a pedal, just like at the start of the piece.  The difference is that the bass pedal is not a dominant rather than a tonic; it needs to be resolved.  But it goes on!  After two bars, we've relaxed, but that pedal still needs to be resolved, so in 19 and 20 the tension keeps building and building!  The chords are fairly simple, hovering around the V and sometimes resolving to a i and sometimes un-resolving back to V, or ii, etc.  The pedal finally resolves ot 21 beat 2, where... OH SHIT, NO IT DOESN'T!  You think the F and Ab mean an F minor chord, but it's not in root position, and the bass adds a B and a D, making this a total fakeout: what you thought was a i is actually viio7/V!  And that goes right back to V, the pedal now an octave lower, until it <em>finally</em> resolves to I at the very end, with the Picardy third.</p>
<h4 class="question">Why does Bach add a fifth voice in the last beat of the piece before the last note?</h4>
<p class="text">As I mentioned before, it's just something he does, but there's another reason.  Look at how each voice moves into the final chord.  The bass goes C - F, the tenor goes G - F, the alto goes Bb - A, the mezzo-soprano goes C - C, and the soprano goes E - F.  We have C G Bb C E to F F A C F.  If we took out any of these voices, we would no longer have a complete chord at one (or both) positions.  No bass and we no longer have the powerful root-position V - I.  No tenor, and the first chord has no fifth.  No alto, and the first chord has no seventh and the second has no third.  No mezzo, and the final chord has no fifth.  No soprano, and the first chord has no third.  The problem is that there's no way to resolve a complete V7 into a complete I without awkward voice leading.  the leading tone, the 3rd of the V7 chord, wants to resolve up to 1; the bass obviously needs to go to the 1; the 7th of the V7 chord needs to go down to the 3.  So that leaves the 5 of the V7 and the 5 of the I chord, and if those two are matched up, there are parallel fifths with the bass.  The two common solutions are to have the leading tone <em>not</em> resolve to the tonic and instead go to the fifth, which is unsatisfying but you can hide it in an inner voice and mitigate its impact, or just to have one of the chords left incomplete.  Bach took a third option: adding a voice.  With five voices, it's possible to make it work.</p>
<p class="text">Let's look at some more pedal points.  This time I'm going to skip the analysis and just focus on the pedals themselves.  I'd love to do an analysis of this piece, but it's quite long so it probably won't happen in this book so... do your own?  The piece is also from the Well-Tempered Clavier Book I, this time, <a href="">Fugue 4 in C# minor</a>, of which we saw a bit back in <? exampleLink('Fugue 4 exposition'); ?>.  I'm now excerpting from the end of the piece (in five separate voices to make it easier to read):</p>

<? createExample('Fugue 4 Book I ending'); ?>

<p class="text">The (synthesized) recording is of my very first arrangement (which was actually played by a live wind ensemble at one point but I don't have a digitized recording) so please excuse the orchestration mistakes, the shitty balance, the awful suspended cymbal roll (they improved it in later versions of Sibelius, but at the time that was the best I could do). etc.  The excerpted section starts at about 2:45 in the recording.</p>
<h4 class="question">Uh, what's up with the tempo?  And is it just me or does it feel... flat?</h4>
<p class="text">I like the tempo, thank you very much.  Bach didn't write tempo markings for this music, so I get to make up my own.  I think the piece has much more character this way.  As for the flatness, well, no wind orchestra wants to read in four sharps, so I bumped the key down to C minor.  Didn't seem like a big deal at the time, but it sounds weird to me now.  The problem is all the transposing instruments; reading in four sharps isn't <em>too</em> too bad, but what about the horns who have five?  The clarinets and trumpets with six?  The alto and bari saxes with <em>seven</em>?  Going down to C minor makes everyone but the purists happy.  I've been fortunate enough to play much of Bach's Art of Fugue for wind orchestra (transcribed by Ken Amis), and that was in C minor too, despite the original being in D minor.  I think I'm in good company here.</p>
<p class="text">There are two pedals in this excerpt.  The first is a dominant pedal starting at 105, and the second is a tonic pedal starting at 112.  The dominant pedal is in the bass, and like we saw in <? exampleLink('Prelude 12 Book I'); ?>, it serves to build tension towards a climax.  I hear that climax as starting at 109 beat 3 and finally releasing at 112.  The harmonies start out as V's and i's, then at 106 we get IV - V - i (IV featuring the raised 6th in the soprano).  There's actually a <em>cross-relation</em> in that measure; notice the A# in the soprano followed by an A natural in the mezzo!  That IV - V - i resolves the pedal... OH SHIT, NO IT DOESN'T!  107 starts the fugue subject again in the soprano with that whole note C# (this is how the fugue starts, whole note C#, then B# E D#), and the pedal is still going!  It finally ends not in a i but in the chord we see at 109 beat 3, a V6/V, which <em>then</em> goes to V at 110 and 111 for a while longer, and <em>then</em> it resolves at 112...</p>
<p class="text">OH SHIT, NO IT DOESN'T!  The dominant pedal resolves, but the resolution is not done!  This is actually a double tonic pedal in both the soprano and the bass, which Bach can do because, hey, five voices.  The three inner voices noodle around for three bars before finally settling on the I, with that Picardy third.  The harmonies start out pretty dissonant at 112, but it actually kind of feels like we're in F# minor, with C# as the dominant.  The subject is restated in the mezzo on F#, F# E# A G#, but G# is the fifth of C#m so that's actually a resolution, not a modulation.  The harmony is taking those three melodies to settle, which is the opposite of the dominant pedal, which ratchets <em>up</em> the tension.  A tonic pedal at the end of a piece is a denouement, happening <em>after</em> the climax.  <? exampleLink('Prelude 12 Book I'); ?> is short, only 22 bars long, so it has a dominant pedal to ratchet up the tension to the last chord, which is the climax.  But this fugue is much longer, 115 measures, and it has a <em>lot</em> of content, packed very densely.  It needs to breathe a bit after the climax, and that's what this tonic pedal is all about.  It prolongs the ending once the piece is essentially already over.</p>
<h4 class="question">Wow, all this drama.</h4>
<p class="text">That's Bach for you!  I think a lot of people don't quite realize this aspect of Bach's music.  To those who don't know much about classical music, all old composers from centuries ago were stern, humorless men who would never <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozart_and_scatology">write music telling a woman to shit in her bed</a>.  To those who know a bit more about it, Bach has a reputation for being mathematical and religious.  In real life, Bach really was kind of stern and humorless, but man, could he put on a show!  In his lifetime, he was known more as a musician than as a composer.  He <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Musical_Offering">apparently</a> improvised a fugue in <em>six</em> voices as a challenge once.  And let's not forget, he wrote the famous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPWBNESumc0">Toccata and Fugue in D minor</a>.</p>
<h4 class="question">But did he, though?</h4>
<p class="text"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toccata_and_Fugue_in_D_minor,_BWV_565">Ehhhhh...</a></p>
<p class="text">The point is that Bach was indeed perfectly capable of being dramatic when he wanted to.  If he hadn't been, his pieces would be a lot less exciting to listen to.  He's known for his counterpoint and his fugues, but the reason his fugues are so good is because he understood how to make music manage the listeners' expectations.  To <em>play</em> Bach mechanically is to miss a huge chunk of the music he invented.</p>
<p class="text">Speaking of invention, let's do one more Bach example.</p>
<h4 class="question">Is it... an Invention?</h4>
<p class="text">Whoa, how did you guess?  Yep, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66eKPSVBNio">Two-Part Invention 10, in G major</a>.  (You can even see an <a href-"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3jtGmSxAYs">analysis video</a> on this piece.)  Bach wrote a set of 15 Two-Part Inventions in easy keys (C, Cm, D, Dm, Eb, E, Em, F, Fm, G, Gm, A, Am, Bb, Bm) and a set of 15 Three-Part Inventions, also called Sinfonias, in the same keys.  They're intended as educational tools for keyboard students to learn hand independence, since they all use imitative counterpoint and are fairly easy (the Two-Part Invention in Cm is even a strict canon, lots of fun to play).</p>

<? createExample('Invention 10'); ?>

<p class="text">Let's first call attention to the pedals.  There are three in a row!  They start at 20 in the soprano, and they take an interesting shape.  At 20, we're holding — no, trilling — a C for two bars, which is the 4 of the scale (we modulated to D in measure 7, but by 16 we're back in G).  The first chord is an Am chord, where the C is the third, and it goes into a D7 chord, where the C is the seventh.  Then, that seventh resolves down, like sevenths usually do in Bach, and now we have a trilled B, first the third of the G chord and then the fifth of the Em chord.  After those two trills, it's the bass's turn to trill, again on a C, which is the root of the IV7 chord and then the seventh of the V7 chord, except before the D comes in, we should probably call it a viio instead.  Since the C is in the bass, it's viio64, and it's measure 26 when the trilled C changes that the C becomes the bass of a V42 chord.</p>
<h4 class="question">These pedals aren't non-harmonic!  Why are they trilled?</h4>
<p class="text">Let's review our ornaments (see <? sectionLinkShort('notation ornaments'); ?> for more info).  In measure 2, that little wavy line is called a mordent (also known as an inverted mordent), which means you play the note, then the note above (diatonically unless otherwise specified), then back to the note, fairly quickly.  The little wavy line with the vertical line through it at measure 7 is called an inverted mordent (also known as a mordent), which is the inverse of the other one: play the note, then the note below it, then back to the note.  The trill, in measures 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25, is like the note above mordent except that you keep alternating between the notes, fairly quickly.  So the soprano at 20 keeps alternating between C and D.</p>
<p class="text">Why?  Because the Inventions and Sinfonias are fairly explicitly keyboard works, and keyboards have no sustain.  Bach wanted to make sure that you heard that C.  The C is unstable at 21, so hammering it with that trill ratchets up the tension.  The trill is how you'd write a crescendo for a held voice on a keyboard.  You can roll on a snare drum or a xylophone, but that doesn't really work on the keyboard.  Since the students playing this would probably have been playing on a harpsichord anyway, which is incapable of dynamics, or a clavichord, which is even less capable of dynamics, a regular crescendo wouldn't cut it.</p>
<h4 class="question">If they're part of the harmony, why are they pedals and not simply held notes between chords?  Aren't all held notes pedals, then?</h4>
<p class="text">The main distinguishing feature is that these pedals call attention to themselves: the <em>fact</em> that they're held between chords is important.  In this piece, there are often notes in common between chords, but they aren't <em>held</em> because that's not the style of this piece.  These notes being held is different; it's interesting; it's striking.  Shared notes are generally boring rather than exciting; the pedal, on the other hand, is usually exciting.</p>
<p class="text">I want to take a look at the harmony of this piece.  It's not actually very interesting on its own, but that's OK.</p>
<h4 class="question">How did you come up with all these Roman numerals if there are only two voices and they can't actually make chords?</h4>
<p class="text">Good question.  The easy answer is that, for most of the piece, both voices are playing arpeggios anyway that outline a chord very clearly.  Look at the soprano at the first measure: G B D B G D B G G.  How is that <em>not</em> a G major triad?  It's not always obvious, but here, it's obvious.  The problem is that Bach is crafty: he doesn't always put the most important note on the downbeat.  So, at 3, you have a V7/IV, and it resolves to IV at 4... but no, that's actually a ii — I mean, viiø7.  From the first two notes (and the earlier secondary dominant), it appears to be C major.  But the A in the soprano tells us that it's actually Am, not C.  The F# changes that further to F#ø7.  The end of the measure cements that notion.  Measure 5 proceeds in the same way, and so does measure 6.  In fact, look, it's a sequence!  Measure 5 is exactly like 4 except a step down, and measure 6 is exactly like 5 except a step down.  The pattern breaks at 7, but now it's actually a <em>new</em> sequence in D major, this only two measures long.  Sequences are nice because you recognize the material the second time through, giving you a warm sense of familiarity.  Because this piece is so economical in terms of melodic material, sequences are a great way to keep things interesting.  There are a few of them throughout; see if you can find them!</p>
<p class="text">In my synthesized recording, I kind of had to pick where the climax was going to be, where the music actually got loud.  You can listen to it and figure out where I put it, but I can also just tell you.  The two soprano pedals are interesting and create some tension by moving a chord around, but it's the bass pedal that really tenses it up.  26 is how the pedal gets resolved.  The soprano has an ornamented arpeggio up, while the bass goes up and then down.  Both arrive at the downbeat of 27, which I consider the climax.  The soprano has the same melody as in the opening, so this is a triumphant return.  At the same time, we know that the piece is coming to an end when we hear that return.  There's one thing that actually makes it a bit weaker than it has to be: the bass arrives on the B, not the G.  This is important, because the C wants to resolve down by step to B; a dominant pedal would have been able to resolve to G with no awkwardness.  We do get back to a root position harmony right away.  I feel a bit awkward about that; with only two voices, both of them active, it's very hard to pinpoint a chord inversion.  I think the C resolving to B is important enough to justify calling it a I6 instead of just a I, but at the same time, the bass does <em>become</em> the G.  The same thing happens in the next measure.  I wouldn't call it a change in chord or even a change in inversion.  I think the chord is just revealed slowly.  At first you think it's going to be a I6, but then you see that it's a I.  But the I6 is important.</p>
<p class="text">By the way, I love the ending.  I think it's cute.  Most of the Inventions end with a final chord, but this one ends with a little arpeggio on each voice.  With two voices it's actually impossible to create complete chords, so most of the Inventions just don't: they end with an octave.  Some add an extra voice for the last chord and a bit, like the prelude in <? exampleLink('Prelude 12 Book I'); ?>.  But this one just goes in a different direction, opting for a small ending rather than a big one.</p>
<p class="text">We can look at pedals in Bach all day.</p>
<h4 class="question">I feel like we have.</h4>
<p class="text">Shut up.  Now, though, I want to look at something completely different: Tom Jobim's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SD0LnNrBm8">Samba de Uma Nota Só</a> (One Note Samba).  This is a jazz standard (for a jazzier version in English, check 2:10 in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDzWWmscbt8">this video by Astrud Gilberto and Stan Getz</a>), so there's no particular way to play it; I've written a simple transcription of the first third or so with guitar accompaniment based on that video and on various guitar chords and lead sheets I've been able to find online:</p>

<? createExample('One Note Samba'); ?>

<h4 class="question">Before we do anything, what's a caxixi?</h4>
<p class="text">An African shaker used in, among other things, Brazilian music, pronounced "ka-shee-SHEE".  I'm sure a more Western-style shaker would have done just fine here, but I have the option, so hey!  Anyway.</p>
<p class="text">There are four pedals here, all in the melody.  The first, second, and fourth are dominant pedals, and the third is a tonic pedal.  ...Or is it?</p>
<h4 class="question">It is.  But it doesn't feel like it is.  Wait.</h4>
<p class="text">It's actually another dominant pedal, but we've modulated up a fourth!  Ambiguity!  This method of writing pedal points is common in Tom Jobim's music; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1tOV7y94DY">Águas de Março</a> is based on a similar thing.  The way this works is that some note is held constant while the chords move around it, chromatically descending for the most part.  In this example, the E pedal has basses going C# - C - B - Bb (and going on to A the last time), and the A pedal has E - Eb - D - G, breaking the pattern a bit.  The pedal is never <em>non-harmonic</em> in this case, because it's jazz and any note is harmonic if it's played in the chord.  Águas de Março uses a tonic pedal instead, again with chromatically descending chords for the most part.</p>
<p class="text">These chords here are not really very functional, so the Roman numeral analysis is a bit limited, but we'll do our best.  iii7 is a jazz version of I6 (it's missing the root and has some extra extensions, but it's got most of the I chord, right?).  The bIIIdom7 is a bit harder to explain.  To me it looks like a chromatic mediant.  We'll talk about those... at some point.  The ii74, or better yet, ii11, is a common pre-dominant sonority in jazz.  The 11th of the ii chord is the 5 of the scale, which is the root of the V, so if you use a ii11 in a ii - V - I, you can afford to make the V more interesting.  And this is what happens here.  The FrV43 is just a fancy symbol for what in jazz is called a <em>tritone substitution</em>.  Bb7b5 actually has the same notes as E7b5 (enharmonically); FrV43 is a French augmented 6th chord (1 3 #4 #6) built on scale degree b2.  We'll talk about this more in a few sections, but while it's rare in classical music, it's a very common feature in jazz.  In fact, you could even think of the bIIIdom7 as a FrV43/ii and the iii7 as a ii7/ii, which keeps everything nice and functional.  The FrV43 finally resolves to I at the very end, but there, I was a bit stuck, because Roman numeral theory can't deal with an added 6th very easily.  I wrote the alternative reading of the A6 chord underneath as a F#m7 in first inversion, which it is, just with a very different function.</p>
<p class="text">This section of the song is in AABA form, and we've looked at the chords in the A section.  In the B section, we basically go up a fourth in the melody but we only go up a third in the chord roots.  The first chord is your classic quartal 11th chord, serving as a ii in the key of D, followed by the tritone sub of the V7 in the key of D, followed by the D itself.  But then we go to... G9?  What's this?  bVII7 - I is known as a <em>backdoor cadence</em>, fairly common in jazz; we'll look at that later too.  The G9 is the bVII7 — well, bVII9.  The backdoor cadence is interrupted, though, because the bVII7 goes to iii7 rather than to I.  For those of you keeping track at home, that's two tritone leaps, one from the Bb7b5 into Em11 and the other here from G9 to C#m7.</p>
<h4 class="question">What's up with the voice leading in this song?</h4>
<p class="text">The guitar just has block chords instead of independent voices, so the voice leading is not so important.  THe secret is that the pedal in the melody keeps the song grounded.  The harmony can do whatever it wants, but it always has that common tone, which means that it never gets too awkward.  And those tritones actually come from things not getting resolved.  The Bb - E tritone should actually be A - E, but the A never arrives; similarly, the G - C# should really be G - A, but the A is substituted with a C# instead.</p>
<p class="text">Tom Jobim's boring melody means that he can get away with a ton of interesting stuff in the harmony.  Pedals are often great opportunities to get wild and creative, since you can introduce distant chords without sacrificing coherence so long as they have the pedal as a common tone.  Interestingly, the boring melodies are 100% intentional.  If you pay attention to the words, the one-note samba conceit is that the one note refers to the singer's loved one, and the singer's focus on that one note is superior to wanting to have all the notes at once and not getting any fulfillment out of that.  Or something.  The point is that the boringness has a story purpose.</p>
<p class="text">Pedal points are very common in music and can serve a variety of goals.  You should explore for yourself.  Every pedal point tells a different story, and we don't have time to explore every single one here.</p>

<h3 class="subsection-title" id="macroharmony">9.2.5 Non-Harmonic Tones and Macroharmony</h3>

<p class="text">Non-harmonic tones are not part of the harmony, but they <em>are</em> part of the <em>macro</em>harmony.  If you recall, the macroharmony is the overall feeling of mode, which individual chords live inside (though you could also think of individual chords as being the center of their own macroharmonies).  E F E over a C major chord has F as a neighbor tone and implies the C major scale, while E F# E over a C major chord has F# as a neighbor tone and implies the C lydian scale, or G major or E minor or something like that.  This means that if you want to emphasize the mode, one of the ways to do that is by introducing non-harmonic tones that contribute to the desired modal effect.  This is something I was actively thinking about when I wrote <a href="https://offtonic.com/music/other.php#luthien">Beren and Lúthien</a>:</p>

<? createExample('Beren and Lúthien first four lines', true); ?>

<p class="text">I'd like to call attention to the right hand in the piano.  I wanted to create a flowing sound, but plain scales or arpeggios were too boring for me.  What to do?  Well, I thought about this: what other notes could I add to this D minor chord in measure 1 that would sound good in this 16th note run without sounding too much like a plain old scale?  I used the C, so you <em>could</em> think of this as a Dm7 chord, but the C resolves into the D, not into the B, so the C is a neighbor tone of the D, not a chord tone.  Then the next chord; what could I add?  I figured the E would give it some complexity.  The F major chord, what to add?  The E, but that one feels more like a chord tone of an FM7 chord.  The D passing tone is because I didn't want the F on the stronger beat, the third eighth note of the chord, so I had to delay the E by a 16th.  Alternatively, you could hear this chord as a i65, a Dm7/F, where the D is the chord tone, not the non-harmonic tone, but something definitely changes when the E comes in.  The second chord in measure 2 is similar, but here, the question was which notes should go above the E, which is needed for the scalar bass.  Notice that there's no B, so it's not an E minor chord.  It's a bVII6!  In Common Practice music you don't see this, but you also wouldn't use a C as a neighbor tone to the D in D minor — you'd use C#.  The fact that this uses the C immediately establishes the dorian modality.  Within the first five eighth notes, we have the C in the piano and the B in the soprano as well as the D minor chord in the piano on beat 1, so that's minor, raised 6th, lowered 7th; it's dorian!</p>
<p class="text">By the way, you might expect the arpeggio figuration thingy to be a compound melody.  It would have been, had I understood compound melodies back in 2005 when I wrote this.</p>
<h4 class="question">2005?  It says 2006.</h4>
<p class="text">I finished the piece in 2006.  I started it in 2005, and I started with this section, but then I put it down for a while.  Regardless, had I read this very book at the time, I might have done cool stuff from one chord to the next, but I didn't.  I think it still works; it's just not as unified as it might have otherwise been.  I also would definitely have stuck a flat in the key signature, and I probably wouldn't have left the Bdim chord in measure 7 in root position.  Or maybe I would.  It fits the bass line.</p>
<p class="text">What non-harmonic tone do you figure is the D in the soprano in measure 2?</p>
<h4 class="question">Chord tone?  Wait, no, it's not.  Hm...  Is it one of those random non-harmonic tones you mentioned earlier?</h4>
<p class="text">No, actually.  It's a kind of anticipation.  The D belongs to the next chord, the downbeat of measure 3, but it comes an eighth note early.  It's not offensive to the ear because it's a repetition of the melody introduction from just two bars earlier; we <em>expect</em> a pickup D to "resolve" up to A, and it does that twice in the soprano and once in the tenor.</p>
<p class="text">There's one other melodic thing I want to point out that has little to do with non-harmonic tones.  If you look at the soprano melody, you can see that it follows a scale.  The first two bars are a descending scale fragment, B A G; the next two are an ascending scale, A B C D E F, leading to the high point of the passage.  The next four bars descend all the way from the top, with a few skips: F E D, B A G F, D.</p>
<h4 class="question">Where the hell are you getting these notes from?</h4>
<p class="text">Look:</p>

<? createExample('Beren Luthien melody'); ?>

<p class="text">This kind of thing is an example of <em>structural analysis</em> of a melody.  The "important" notes are highlighted with the long beams.  Important in this case refers to how much they contribute to the contour of the melody.  There are other notes of perhaps secondary and tertiary importance.  The A in the downbeat is probably secondary or even primary, while the eighth notes on the weaker beats are tertiary.  From these highlighted "important" notes, though, you can easily tell at a glance what the contour is and how the melody achieves it.  I have to admit that I wasn't thinking of this at all when I wrote the melody.</p>
<h4 class="question">Huh, so what were you thinking about?</h4>
<p class="text"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4J87DQNkTM">This recording</a> of the Turtle Creek Chorale and the Dallas Wind Symphony perform Randall Thompson's Frostiana, movement VI, Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening.  I downloaded this long ago for some reason, and it stuck with me.  I used to listen to it in bed.  It's in a slow 6/8, and when I decided to write a melody for Tolkien's poem Beren and Lúthien, my reference for how poems should be set to music was Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening.  You can probably hear the similarities now.  The melodies are in different modes and diverge pretty thoroughly, but I, I used the mode less traveled, and that has made all the difference.</p>
<h4 class="question">Booo.</h4>
<p class="text">I think that's it for my Robert Frost references.  But the similarities are there, especially in how both melodies use these scales in a slow 6/8.  My melody travels the scale more slowly, since for the most part I use the third eighth note of the beat to go away from the scale, but it's still a scale.  I didn't <em>copy</em> Randall Thompson.  That was just my jumping-off point, in my head, for how to sing the poem, and I composed the melody that way, by figuring out what I thought sounded good.  It helps that both poems use similar meter — "Whose <em>woods</em> these <em>are</em> I <em>think</em> I <em>know</em>" versus "The <em>leaves</em> were <em>long</em>, the <em>grass</em> was <em>green</em>".  The weak-strong metrical foot is called an <em>iamb</em>, and there are four of them in the line, so poetically, it's iambic tetrameter.  Frost's poem, however, uses four lines of iambic tetrameter per stanza (rhyme scheme AABA), while Tolkien's is a bit more complicated: three lines of iambic tetrameter followed by a line with the pattern weak-strong weak-strong-weak strong-weak-weak, which is an iamb, an amphibrach, and a dactyl, and that whole thing is repeated for a total of eight lines, with rhyme scheme ABACBABC.  That meant that my melody could have two halves, with variations in the second half.  If you listen to the entire piece, you can hear how that goes.</p>
<p class="text">This concludes our introduction to non-harmonic tones.  There's one more thing we need to learn before we can properly start learning about the Roman numerals, and it's in the next section.  For now, I'd suggest that you look at some music, especially in genres I haven't covered here, and analyze how it uses non-harmonic tones.  Almost all music with harmony has them.</p>

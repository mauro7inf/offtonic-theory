<p class="text">The first thing we need to determine when we're composing is... what we're actually trying to accomplish.</p>
<h4 class="question">Duh.  Isn't that completely obvious to everyone?</h4>
<p class="text">Yes, but there are subtleties in answering this question that we need to think about.  90% of this may seem obvious to you, but 10% won't, and perhaps those 10% will be completely obvious to someone else while part of what was obvious to you won't be to them.  That's why we're talking about this.  At some point during the compositional process, we'll be "done".  What is this thing that we have produced with our compositional labor?  It's not necessarily a piece of music — and if it is, what form does this piece of music even take?  Well, there are a few basic choices:</p>

<? createTableOfContents($label) ?>

<h3 class="subsection-title" id="product-sheet-music">8.1.1 Sheet Music</h3>

<p class="text">A composer of Western art music generally creates <em>sheet music</em>.  We spent basically all of Part I learning to read it, so you presumably know what sheet music is by now.</p>
<h4 class="question">...Yes.  Yes I do.</h4>
<p class="text">Good.  But I'll tell you anyway.  Sheet music is a set of <em>instructions</em> for performing a piece of music.  It's not music.</p>
<h4 class="question">It's not?  But people refer to it as "the music" all the time!</h4>
<p class="text">That's true.  Colloquially, it's "the music".  But it's not <em>really</em> the music.  The real music is the sound that you hear (or even imagine).  Sheet music requires a musician of some sort to turn it into music.  So it's really an intermediate product, but Western art music has a kind of division of labor: the composer composes the piece and writes the sheet music, and some musicians get together and make the written music come to life, possibly with the aid of the composer but often without.  You can go on <a href="http://imslp.org/">IMSLP</a> and download some sheet music that someone else composed.  You've seen lots of examples throughout the book already.</p>
<p class="text">While we tend to use a common language for sheet music using 5-line staves, clefs, time signatures, and so on, "sheet music" here can refer to really any set of instructions for how to play a piece of music.  Guitar tab, graphical scores, written note names, even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantillation">cantillation marks</a>, those are all essentially the same kind of thing.  In all of these, the basic creative work is done by a composer ahead of time, who prepares a set of instructions to musicians, who then produce the actual sound.</p>
<h4 class="question">What happens when there are many musicians?</h4>
<p class="text">That's going to depend on the style of music.  When many musicians are involved, the product is generally a <em>score</em>, which shows each of the parts performed by the musicians (who may, depending on circumstances, perform multiple parts at the same time, or many musicians could perform the same part).  We've seen plenty of scores so far, but a somewhat nice one is back in <? exampleLink('Stars and Stripes'); ?>.  There's a link to the score on IMSLP for a fuller picture.  In that example, there's just one tuba part, but there are likely multiple tuba players playing that same part.  Scores often put multiple parts on the same line, as in the clarinet line, where some clarinets play the upper notes and others play the lower notes.  But if you look at the score on IMSLP, you may notice something interesting...</p>
<h4 class="question">What?</h4>
<p class="text">The key signatures are different for each instrument!</p>
<h4 class="question">Holy crap, why?  Oh, right, because they're transposing instruments, right?</h4>
<p class="text">Yep.  We're going to talk about orchestration later so we can discuss transposing instruments more in depth.</p>
<h4 class="question">So how the hell do you deal with that as a composer?</h4>
<p class="text">Writing a score is not very easy.  It's actually not very hard either, not anymore, but it used to be much harder.  With so many things happening at once, how can you keep it all straight?  Thankfully, composers today have musical notation programs that make the process of hearing what you wrote <em>FAR</em> easier.  In the past, you had to use a piano (or other instrument) to sound things out, and of course you wouldn't even get a hint of what the orchestration was doing, so you needed a ton of experience and probably your own chamber orchestra that you could convince to run through your music so that you could hear what was going on.  And of course, Beethoven didn't even get that in his later days after he had gone deaf!  It requires a lot of imagination.  One thing that I find makes it easier is to write as if the instruments are <em>not</em> transposing.  This way, I can look at a chord and understand what it is without having to do calculations.  Sibelius, my musical notation program of choice, allows me to switch between a transposing score (each instrument pitched where it should be) and a non-transposing score (all instruments non-transposing) with a single button click.  Even a few decades ago, composers did not have that luxury and had to resort to other techniques.</p>
<h4 class="question">How does, say, a flute player read this score?  It's really small...</h4>
<p class="text">Most musicians don't actually read scores.  They read <em>parts</em>.  A score contains all of the parts (ideally); a part only contains one part, or maybe two or three.  One is most common for instrumentalists.  The conductor of the orchestra uses the score to see what all of the parts are at the same time; the girl playing Eb Alto Sax 1, on the other hand, has no idea what the guy playing Bb Clarinet 3 is playing and probably even less of an idea what's going on in the Percussion 4 part.  Sometimes there's a <em>condensed score</em>, which is a score that has just a few staves and doesn't bother replicating all the parts exactly.  You can compare the full score with the condensed score for <a href="http://imslp.org/wiki/The_Stars_and_Stripes_Forever_(Sousa,_John_Philip)">The Stars and Stripes Forever</a>.  The condensed score here is actually missing the percussion, which is frustrating!  You can also look at instrumental parts for this piece at the link in the Parts tab.</p>
<p class="text">On the other hand, choral music may take a different approach.  If the piece is for <em>a cappella</em> chorus, meaning there are just voices, everyone may read a score, or, if there are many voice parts, perhaps the women have a part and the men have a part, both of which contain several parts (soprano 1, soprano 2, alto 1, alto 2, etc.).  If the piece is for chorus and orchestra, the singers may read parts like these, or they may read a <em>rehearsal score</em>, which transcribes the orchestral parts into a single piano part that a rehearsal pianist can use to accompany the ensemble instead of needing the full orchestra for rehearsals.</p>
<h4 class="question">So then how does the conductor read the score?</h4>
<p class="text">Very slowly and not during rehearsal!  The conductor has to get a good sense of the music <em>before</em> trying to conduct it, and whenever there are special, non-obvious things that the conductor needs to do — giving a cue, for example — that gets written in, always in pencil so that it can be erased later.  The score generally lists instruments in <em>score order</em>, a sort-of standard order that generally groups woodwinds from high to low, brass from high to low, percussion (including piano and harp), voices from high to low, and strings from high to low, with some quirks here and there.  We'll talk more about score order later.  There may well be reasons to use a different order; for example, there may be separate choirs that would get their own visually separated section of the score.  This could happen when a piece of music features an ensemble of soloists or a separate smaller group off-stage (where it will sound much more distant) or even two similar groups on the same stage, working in counterpoint.</p>
<p class="text">As for actually reading, the only thing you can really do with a large orchestral score is quickly scan it as you follow the music.  It's too small to read in detail and it goes by way too quickly.  I've heard that a useful way to scan the page is diagonally from top left to bottom right; that way you get a sense of what each instrumental group is doing.  On the other hand, a condensed score is <em>far</em> easier to read.  As the conductor, you should know what the music is supposed to sound like before you conduct it, because there's just no way to figure it out from the score in real time.</p>
<p class="text">I'm talking a bit about orchestral conductors here, but to get back to the topic at hand, <em>composition</em>, not all sheet music requires a conductor to rehearse and perform (and record); smaller ensembles or solos don't need one.  When a conductor <em>is</em> employed, that further cements the division of labor: the composer creates the sheet music at some point in time.  At some later point in time, some musicians read and perform that sheet music, thus making real music.  A conductor serves to keep those musicians together, but like the composer, the conductor is not actually making the music!  Of course, the composer can always conduct and/or play his or her own compositions.  An orchestral conductor can't play an instrument while conducting, but smaller ensembles usually have a leader who may lead tempo changes and pauses by nodding, and a singing group could have a conductor who sings with the group (as I do in my a cappella group).  Beethoven famously conducted his own symphonies, including his 9th, which he composed after going deaf.  He hadn't realized the music had ended and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_No._9_(Beethoven)#Premiere">just kept conducting</a> until one of the soloists told him to take his bow!  (Don't worry, the orchestra was actually watching a different conductor the whole time.)</p>
<p class="text">There are upsides and downsides to creating sheet music as a product.  The main downside is the loss of creative control.  Once you've written the music, it's up to someone else to realize it, and possibly many people will realize it differently.  Interpreting sheet music involves making choices in tempos, expression, etc., sometimes even changing a note here or there, and even that's composition too, just on a much lower level.  As the composer, you have to be OK with the fact that things will not go exactly as you planned.  The main upside, on the other hand, is that it provides a valuable product for musicians who don't want to compose their own music.  Composers are generally far more rare than musicians in general.</p>
<p class="text">The loss of creative control can actually be more of a feature than a bug; some pieces specify things very precisely while others may leave a lot of the choices up to the performer.  The quintessential example is Terry Riley's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNi0bukYRnA">In C</a>, which consists of 53 numbered segments of music to be played in order by each musician in the ensemble, each repeated as many times as that individual performer wishes, with the net effect that the piece will sound different every time.  Another very common example is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleatoric_music">aleatoric music</a>, which may involve improvisation, random mashing of keys on various instruments, playing specific phrases at varying tempos, stuff like that.  Improv jazz is basically aleatoric music, though you wouldn't generally call it that.  In these cases, the sheet music provides a framework for further composition.</p>
<p class="text">Sheet music also allows for efficient transmission: just print it in a book!  You can read sheet music at your own pace; music exists in time, but sheet music does not, so you don't need to read it in time.  Sheet music lets you <em>study</em> it, which you simply can't do with a performance (you can with a recording, but it's painstaking).  Before recordings were available, sheet music was the best way to preserve music, and that's how we know what Bach was playing in his church 300 years ago.  Sheet music was also made for popular consumption, so that your average Joe or Molly would be able to play — and therefore hear — some version of whatever music was popular at the time without having to go to the concert hall.  The alternative before recordings was simply oral transmission, and a lot of music is still taught this way in many parts of the world.  Music is taught master to student through repetition, and of course each person will add his or her own twist.  We're extremely lucky to live in an age where recording music is easy and available, if only because every single audio example in this book (other than the applets) is a recording.  Before then, music had to be written down somehow, and there have been a bunch of notation systems used for the purpose.</p>

<h3 class="subsection-title" id="product-recordings">8.1.2 Recordings</h3>

<p class="text">A recording is the product for commercial music, music used in media, and a whole bunch of genres.  If the sheet music composer is the "highest" level of composition, composing something somewhat abstract that must be realized by musicians, the recording composer is the next level "down", having to mold the music to sound the way he or she desires.</p>
<h4 class="question">Whoa there.  Highest level?  Next level down?  Surely you don't mean to be <em>that</em> elitist.</h4>
<p class="text">Surely not.  I'm talking about levels of abstraction, not levels of... quality or worthiness or anything like that.  When your product is sheet music, you don't have to worry about any aspects of actual sound production, for the most part.  You don't have to worry about finding musicians to play your music — I mean, you probably do, but not as part of the compositional process.  You don't need to worry about how the room sounds, or isolating microphones, or mastering, or how the musicians should arrange themselves spatially (well, you <em>can</em> worry about that in the score and some composers do as I mentioned earlier, but you don't have to).  But when your product is a recording, all of this stuff is now <em>your</em> business.  You can still pass off the responsibility to somebody else.  This happens a lot.  For example, John Williams, film composer of Star Wars fame, writes scores, which are then performed by an orchestra and recorded, and it's edited and mastered and whatever by audio engineers before it goes into the movie.</p>
<h4 class="question">Hm.  Interesting.</h4>
<p class="text">Well, he doesn't actually write his own scores anymore.  He has orchestrators do that for him.  He's pretty old and very famous; he can do that kind of thing.  So while <em>his</em> product is still the sheet music, the overall product here is the recording.</p>
<p class="text">Smaller operations, though, don't have the benefit of a huge movie-budget staff to do all the sound stuff.  I mean like your average pop group.  They write and record their own songs, and they work hard to get the specific sound they're going for.  If you're an EDM producer, that's the same kind of thing; you spend a lot of your time figuring out the precise sound you're going for; you play with timbres and effects and stuff because your goal is to impress the audience — make them dance or whatever you're going for — with this music track that can be played and replayed.</p>
<h4 class="question">Why is an EDM producer a "producer" instead of a "composer"?</h4>
<p class="text">I don't know why they decided on that naming convention specifically, but it makes sense.  In this context, an audio producer is basically a director, handling and delegating a lot of the details for the musicians.  A great example is the so-called "fifth Beatle", <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Martin">George Martin</a>; he did a lot of arranging for the Beatles; he added instrumental tracks to the Beatles' recordings, argued with the members about how best to make their songs, and generally helped with the production.  He died recently, in 2016.</p>
<h4 class="question">Holy fuck, GRRM died in 2016?  I guess we'll never know how A Song of Ice and Fire will end...  I was tired of waiting for the next book anyway.  Whatever.</h4>
<p class="text">What?  No.  George R. R. Martin is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6a1y1pc-GQ">not your bitch</a>.  We're talking about George Henry Martin.  <em>Sir</em> George Henry Martin.  Different dude.</p>
<p class="text">Anyway, his job was producing the Beatles' songs.  You should read about his work if you can; it'll give you great insight into how one of the best bands ever was able to make music.  Just to give you a taste, there's a quartal-sounding chord at the beginning of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYkehpWUjwU">A Hard Day's Night</a> that baffled people for a long time.  They just couldn't figure out the notes, and nothing really sounded right.  The mystery was solved <a href="http://www.noiseaddicts.com/2008/11/beatles-hard-days-night-mystery-chord-solved/">using Fourier analysis</a> (read the paper at the link).  This is the chord:</p>

<? createExample('Hard Days Night chord'); ?>

<h4 class="question">Fourier analysis?  What even is that?  Shit, do I need to do Fourier analysis to write music properly?</h4>
<p class="text">Um...  You don't, but it's helpful to understand some aspects of sound that we'll talk about in a later chapter eventually.  A Fourier analysis takes a sound wave and tells you what frequencies that sound wave contains, producing what we call a <em>spectrum</em>.  Don't worry about this for now.  It sounds complicated, but...  OK, it <em>is</em> complicated.  But you don't actually have to do the complicated part; we have computers to do that for us, almost in real time!  Jason Brown, the mathematician who figured out this chord, just put the sound through a computer program to get the spectrum and did some detailed analysis work on it.</p>
<p class="text">Now, let's analyze the chord.  The guitar and bass parts all read down an octave, and George Harrison's 12-string guitar's strings are actually in pairs in octaves — except for the top two pairs which are unison strings.  So George Harrison actually played a low A and a middle A, a D and a high D, a G and a high G, and a high C twice.  From low to high, we have A2 D3 G3 A3 C4 C4 D4 G4.  Ignoring the doubling, A D G C is a fairly simple quartal chord; it's a simple stack of perfect fourths.  Paul McCartney's bass is just doubling the D and John Lennon's guitar is just doubling the C an octave up.  That's a little bit of orchestration, but it's still your basic quartal chord.  The part that busts this chord wide open is what the "fifth Beatle" George Martin adds to the track: a piano chord that you can't hear very distinctly given the guitar sounds, but it's still there and it adds an F natural and a high E, both of which aren't present elsewhere in the chord.  I think the effect is that the chord is technically a Dm11/A.  In the Beatles' performances, George Martin wasn't up there with them playing keys.  He did this only on the recordings, which is how the vast majority of people got to experience the Beatles' music.  Here he is, doing something completely unique in the sound of the band, and he's not even in the band, technically!  That's the producer.</p>
<p class="text">To tie this into our current chapter, it's good to ask the question: what was the band thinking?  I don't know.  I think there are books on this stuff, and you can probably ask Paul McCartney (though he probably won't answer you).  But if I had to hazard a guess, they just kept trying a bunch of chords until they came up with that quartal sound, and then George Martin decided to spice it up by adding some notes he knew would fit the chord a little but still be dissonant, yet not enough to stick out.  A composer, or a producer in this case, is like a chef creating a dish.  Here, George Martin took a chili-and-mala fried chicken dish and added a little bit of burnt sugar to add some crunch and alter the flavor just a little.  Or something.  I have no idea how to cook.</p>
<h4 class="question">You said he's the "fifth Beatle", but there are only four people playing the chord.</h4>
<p class="text">Uh.  Ringo Starr is the drummer.  He's obviously not going to be playing any notes in a chord.</p>
<h4 class="question">Oh yeah.  Ringo.  I forgot about drummers.</h4>
<p class="text">Percussion is important!  Actually, even when your product is sheet music, if you have any percussion in your score, you have to be extremely careful about the percussion parts.  You actually need to give some thought to how the players will accomplish what you tell them to do.  It can be tempting to simply add percussion hits wherever you want them, but is it practical?  Are you going to make the orchestra hire a dude to play a single cymbal crash once and then go away?  (I've actually had to do something like that before.  It was boring.  And no, I didn't get paid.  I just couldn't say no to stuff like that.)  We'll talk more about percussion when we talk about orchestration.</p>
<p class="text">Moving on.  Recordings.  Recordings allow you to do things that aren't physically possible, as the George Martin example shows.  How can two guitarists, a bassist, and a drummer play that chord?  It's just not physically possible, but in a recording, they can add the piano.  With recordings, you can play multiple instruments on the same track, or sing multiple parts (called <em>multi-tracking</em>).  Want a big choir effect but you only have 4 people?  Just record those 4 people a bunch of times!  You can tweak; you can re-record; you can do magic, essentially.  You can apply effects like auto-tune or chorus effects or pitch shift.  You can turn a bad singer into a good singer just by running an effect, at least if you've isolated the microphones enough (or else you'll get bleed).  You can turn a bad singer into a less bad singer just by recording enough takes and taking the best part of each one.  You can do <em>magic</em>.</p>
<p class="text">The upside of making a recording is that you can really take your time and sculpt the music to your desired level of perfection, and everyone who listens to it will hear that perfection.  Another upside is that if your product is a recording, when you're done composing you actually have <em>music</em>.  Sheet music is not music; a recording is.  The main downside is that nobody else can <em>play</em> your music, since they won't know the notes — look how much effort it took to figure out the notes for just that one chord in A Hard Day's Night!.  People can only listen to it.  Hell, even <em>you</em> may not be able to play your music.  One of Weird Al's most popular songs is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzo6NJBKco">Hardware Store</a>, but he never sings it at concerts.  Why?  Starts at about 2:17.</p>
<h4 class="question">::breathes::  HOLY.  SHIT.</h4>
<p class="text">Chill out.  It's just the magic of recording!  That stuff is multi-tracked.  And that means it can't be performed live or it'll break the illusion entirely when Al takes a breath.  In the recording, he can sing it a bunch of times starting at different places, and the different takes get spliced together so it sounds like he did the whole thing without breathing.</p>
<h4 class="question">Also...  Is that World of Warcraft?</h4>
<p class="text">Heh.  Yep.  2006.  There was no official video for Hardware Store, so someone made one in WoW, and as far as I'm concerned, that's the only video for this song.</p>
<p class="text">Ever since recordings became available, people started listening to them instead of making their own music, since the recordings can sound much better.  Musicians became recording artists, and albums of recordings became the primary method for getting music from producer to listener.  Anyone can enjoy a recording.  Babies can listen to recordings.  It takes a little bit of special training to read sheet music (which luckily you have from Part I of this book), but not to listen.  Recordings also have a major role in media, including movies, games, TV shows, commercials, radio, etc.  A recording can be attached to some piece of media fairly simply.  This seems obvious, but in practical terms, it means that a media composer has a lot of... practicalities to worry about, like precise timing.  A sheet music composer can pass the problem onto the conductor, but if you're making a recording, you need to get the timing right.</p>
<h4 class="question">How do people do that?</h4>
<p class="text">There are a couple of possibilities.  A producer generally works with a DAW, a <em>Digital Audio Workstation</em>, which can provide a metronome at some given tempo for live instruments, and it can often provide synths and synth interfaces for virtual instruments.  Often a track can be written in <em>piano roll notation</em>, where the notes are listed on the left side and time goes left to right, and there's a filled-in rectangle whenever there's a note.  This is similar to the holes read by player pianos, hence the name.  For live instruments, the metronome is called a <em>click track</em>.  When I record with my a cappella group, I make special tracks with metronome clicks at the desired tempo (which doesn't necessarily stay constant throughout the piece, hence the need for special tracks instead of just the metronome) and synthesized recordings of the song itself to keep people together and in tune.  Those tracks get mixed out of the final product.  In a live performance, you might consider this cheating, but a recording is forever; you really want to get a perfect or near-perfect result if you can.</p>
<p class="text">Recordings also take a deceptively long amount of time to prepare, depending on how you do it and how much of a perfectionist you are.  Unless you're extremely good at your craft, you're not going to get it right in one take, first of all.  Then there's all the editing and post-production, even after you've had enough great takes.  If you're going to do it the right way, you'll want to record each musician individually to prevent bleed.  Of course, if you have a group of 12 musicians, doing one at a time will take 12 times the duration.  In contrast to sheet music, recordings are a <em>whole lot</em> more work.  With sheet music as your final product, you usually pass the buck to someone else.</p>
<p class="text">Composing for a recording takes a different kind of thinking from composing for a score.  It's both more practical and more perfectionist, and it allows for effects that are not physically possible in a live performance.</p>

<h3 class="subsection-title" id="product-performance">8.1.3 Performance</h3>

<p class="text">The final major type of product for a composer is the performance.</p>
<h4 class="question">Isn't that part of the other two?</h4>
<p class="text">Yes and no.  Recordings, for example, don't ever need to be performed.  Sheet music doesn't need to be performed either, really, but usually performing it is the point.  While sheet music preserves the instructions to create music and recordings preserve the music itself, performances don't preserve anything.  You can create a recording of a performance, sure, but a performance is generally for the benefit of the audience, who's actually there with you, experiencing the music that you're performing.  They may even participate.  Sheet music and recordings may even be components of the performance.</p>
<p class="text">Some examples of performance as the product of composition include improvisation, installations, and a lot of popular music.  Improvisation is composition in the moment; you're performing the music directly as you compose it.  This sounds hard, but with enough practice and muscle memory, it becomes a task of stringing together licks that you already know how to play.  Usually, improvisation is done within some framework: here are some chords; improvise over these chords.  If you're improvising alone, like, say, on a piano, it becomes more similar to plain old composition, but improvisations usually have less structure, because if you plan it all out ahead of time, it's not an improvisation, right?  To improvise well, you generally need a very strong <em>intuitive</em> knowledge of music theory.  You don't need to have book learning; you need to have intuition.  If you want to learn to improvise in some style — doesn't have to be jazz; in <? sectionLinkShort('modes maqamat'); ?> we saw improvisation within a maqam framework, for example — you need to internalize the style, listen to the masters of the style, transcribe their solos, and reverse-engineer what they did.  Or you could just wing it.  If you have the natural talent to do it, you'll create your own new style; if not, you'll just sound like you don't know what you're doing.  Which may be what you're going for, but, you know, probably not.</p>
<p class="text">Installations are a totally different kind of music.  Generally these exist as a sound space that you can explore physically, like a room or object with sounds in different spots, interactivity, etc.  Even a videogame could be considered a music installation; check out this game I'm writing, <a href="http://www.offtonic.com/brickoff/">Brickoff</a>.  As the levels progress, the sounds change; if many people play the game at the same time in the same room, music emerges, similar to Terry Riley's In C that I mentioned earlier.  Another example of a music installation is this church somewhere in Germany that's playing a piece by John Cage <em>REALLY</em> slowly — specifically, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_Slow_as_Possible">As Slow As Possible</a>.  Cage did not include a tempo marking, so performances can go arbitrarily slow and therefore take quite a while.  This particular church in Germany is playing it so slowly that the initial rest took 17 months.  The first note started on February of 2003 and the next note change was in July of 2004.  The performance is slated to take 639 years.  (Some people finish it in 20 minutes.  Not these guys!)  There's a particular long chord that lasts from October of 2013 until September of 2020.  Of course, there <em>is</em> sheet music involved here, too; Cage wrote an eight-page score for the piece.  Cage himself didn't intend for his composition to be played <em>that</em> slow; he just left it generally open-ended.  But just the act of creating an installation is composition.</p>
<p class="text">Popular artists also compose for performance, but in a different way.  Really, any performing artist or group that writes its own music composes for a performance.  In many cases the music isn't even written down; perhaps there are melody and chords on some sheet music, and each musician improvises a part.  They may agree to do something in a particular way, figure out which sections to play when, have this person have the melody on this time through and that person on that time through, etc., making all these decisions during rehearsal or even just before actually performing.  When musicians get together to jam, this is basically what they're doing.  It's never going to happen the exact same way twice, and unlike in a recording, the sound is dictated by what the members can actually do in real life, by the space, the audience, etc.  There are some musical groups that don't exist in real life; they don't meet or perform together, but instead they all record stuff separately and editing magic happens.  I was once asked to participate in someone's film score this way; I went to the studio with my clarinet and met the guy I was helping out; he gave me some music, I played it a few different ways until he found something he liked (along with a synthesized track in my headphones so that I'd be in time and in tune with everyone else), and then I left.  That's not a performance.  On the other hand, there are some groups that don't make recordings in studios; they just make live recordings of their performances.  Those are always going to be of lower quality simply because you can't go back and edit stuff, but it doesn't matter, because their primary goal is not to make recordings but to perform for people.</p>
<p class="text">The downside of performance as the product is that it's not reproducible.  You'll never perform anything the exact same way twice.  A performance is an ephemeral thing; you experience it for as long as it lasts, and then it's over.  You can't study a performance — unless, of course, you record it.  The upside is that, compared to sheet music and a recording, a performance is <em>actually</em> music.</p>
<h4 class="question">You said earlier that the <em>recording</em> was <em>actually</em> music.</h4>
<p class="text">Huh, I did, didn't I?  Well, it's close to being music, but it's not quite there.  <em>Playing</em> the recording is actually music.  I think the distinction is purely philosophical and not particularly important, but there you go.  Still, I'm making this point because, in the end, music is the <em>experience</em> of organized sound that is meant to be music, as we defined music back in the <? sectionLinkShort('intro'); ?>.  Sound itself is an experience.  A recording isn't sound; it gets turned into sound when it's played, generally by some sort of electronic device using speakers.  That production of sound is the performance, but a performance is much more than sound; there's the entire rest of the experience.  You get the sound of the whole space, the closeness or distance of the rest of the audience, the direct line of communication with the performers.  They can react to you and change the music.  A great example of this, which we've talked about before, is John Cage's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4%E2%80%B233%E2%80%B3">4'33"</a>, the archetypal "does this count as music" piece that people always bring up in arguments.</p>
<h4 class="question">That's just a bunch of silence.  The sheet music has rests for the whole thing.  Why are we talking about it in the context of performance?</h4>
<p class="text">Because 4'33" is <em>not</em> just a bunch of silence.  It's the sound of the <em>audience</em>.  To properly listen to this piece of music, one has to <em>experience</em> the performance.  All those assholes coughing?  That's part of the piece!  Seats squeaking as they always do during quiet sections?  Part of the piece.</p>
<h4 class="question">When you say "assholes coughing", do you mean — you know what, never mind.  Forget I asked.</h4>
<p class="text">What?  Whatever.  Moving on:</p>

<h3 class="subsection-title" id="product-others">8.1.4 Other Products</h3>

<p class="text">Those three, sheet music, recordings, and performance, are the main products you're likely to be creating when you compose.  They aren't the only ones.  For example, you could be writing a folk song.</p>
<h4 class="question">Like, folk rock?</h4>
<p class="text">After all this time, you still don't know what folk music is?  Folk music is not a genre.  I mean, there's a genre called "folk", but that's not really folk music.  I'm talking about music meant to be sung by ordinary people.  You might publish sheet music or make recordings or perform it, but its value is in being sung or otherwise performed by people in whatever situations call for it.  Americans tend not to sing very often, which is a damned shame, but in Judaism we have a <em>lot</em> of singing opportunities.  A single Shabbat service can easily have an album's worth of songs.  Specifically, <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Shlomo+Carlebach/Kabbalat+Shabbat">this one</a>.  Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach composed this album of Shabbat songs, which are sung on Friday nights all over the world, much to the annoyance of people who would at least occasionally prefer to hear something a little more traditional, maybe?  The texts are all standard texts from the Bible and the prayerbook, but the melodies are Carlebach's.  Carlebach could not even read music (as far as I know), but he composed a huge wealth of mostly pretty simple and catchy melodies (check his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs2DBoMEWQgllBfnE036AXg">YouTube channel</a>) intended to be sung at services or other events.  He would travel the world and sing his melodies, passing them on to people, as well as publishing albums with recordings, but I would be willing to bet that the vast majority of people who sing his melodies learned them from other people, not performances or recordings, and almost certainly not sheet music (<a href="http://www.offtonic.com/nusach/">although...</a>).</p>
<p class="text">Another example, also in the Jewish world but moving from the Orthodox to the... hippie end of the Jewish spectrum, I guess, is <a href="http://www.rabbishefagold.com/">Rabbi Shefa Gold's chants</a>.  These are generally one line of liturgy, generally sung slowly many times, in a kind of meditation.  I'm just going to say it right now, this is not my kind of thing.  Some of the chants are quite catchy; here's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3lcuzLjtDk">Ozi V'zimrat Yah</a>, the first of these that I've had the chance to sing.  Again, it's not some sheet music to be performed, and it's not some recording to listen to, and it's not some show to see.  It's participatory music, and therefore it <em>has</em> to be simple and catchy so that anyone can sing it at the appropriate time.  For this chant, the text comes from the Song of the Sea (Exodus 15) as well as Psalm 118, so I first heard it during a Shabbat morning service, which features the Song of the Sea, when the congregation sang this chant at those words.</p>
<p class="text">There are actually still people who keep folk song traditions alive around the world, including in the US.  There are still occasions when people compose new songs for this purpose.  People are still writing sea chanteys!  Maritime music is a pretty big thing, with folk festivals (I've been to one, in Portsmouth, NH) and revival singers and everything.  You may not think of it as folk music, but school songs fall into the same category.  There are alma maters, athletic fight songs, etc.  My college happens to have a rich tradition of fight songs, which are performed by the Band, the Glee Club, etc.  I wasn't in the Band, but I was in the Wind Ensemble, so I still got a chance to learn some of these.  While I was an undergrad, a new one was written!  I don't remember it very well because I never learned it, but presumably now it's an established tradition.</p>
<h4 class="question">Why are folk songs an afterthought as an "other product" instead of being a major category?</h4>
<p class="text">I kept folk music as a separate kind of product from the other three because composing folk music puts <em>enormous</em> limitations on the music itself.  Sheet music can be fanciful; recordings can violate the laws of physics; performances are only limited by <em>your</em> skill.  But folk music needs to be accessible to your average non-musical person who can't read sheet music and isn't going to bother learning anything complicated.  We're talking simple, repetitive songs with simple, repetitive words.  A multi-part canon is a remote possibility too, where the group is broken up into different sections that each sings something different.  Each part has to be even simpler in that case.  You can be as creative as you want with sheet music, recordings, and performances, but when it comes to folk music, you can only lead where people will follow.</p>
<p class="text">In addition to folk music, there are other products that may straddle the lines between the other ones, or just be different, or something.  You could have sheet music that specifies that you have to play a recording, for example, combining those two kinds of products in a less obvious way.  Videogame music can also be at various spots in the spectrum.  It can just be a recording, for example, but it may have the special consideration that it has to loop endlessly and not piss off the player or have seams that are too obvious.  Or you could have a <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VariableMix">variable mix</a>, where the music changes continuously as things happen.  Nintendo games have done this for a <em>long</em> time; way back in Super Mario World, bongos get added to the music whenever you're riding Yoshi, but the music doesn't start over or anything.  In more modern Mario games, various sound effects are in the same key — and even the same chord — as the music, so as the music proceeds, the sound effects change to match it!  Is that an installation?  Eh, kinda?</p>
<p class="text">The point is that you can actually be pretty creative and non-traditional when it comes to the form of your music.  You don't have to do things that far out of the box, but you <em>can</em> — if you can dream it, at least!</p>
<h4 class="question">OK, so why are we talking about types of product in the first place?  I understand that they exist, but why do we need to waste so many words on them?</h4>
<p class="text">Well, because...</p>

<h3 class="subsection-title" id="product-comparing">8.1.5 Comparing Products</h3>

<p class="text">...Because the composition process is actually quite different for each one, mechanically, but in the end they're all the same thing.  When we study music theory, we think about music abstractly; we reduce it to its constituent elements and analyze it.  We look at scale degrees and their tendencies, at chords and their resolutions, at phrase lengths and form and whatnot.  But it's important occasionally to have a reality check and look at music more concretely, as an experience rather than an object of analysis.  At the same time, if you want to compose music, you ought to understand your role in the process of creation and how other people might have different roles.</p>
<p class="text">If you're composing sheet music, you dream on paper, essentially.  These days we use notation programs on a computer; I personally use Sibelius just because that's what I bought many years ago and I don't feel the need to switch, but you might want to use Finale or Dorico (made by the original Sibelius devs and probably a superior product, but I've never used it myself), or MuseScore (free) or NoteFlight or LilyPond.  These programs generally let you hear what you're composing, so you don't have to rely so much on your imagination and your sightreading skills.  But regardless, your creation lives in writing.  If you're composing a recording, on the other hand, your creation lives in time.  Maybe you use a DAW (there are a bunch, like Ableton and FL Studio and ProTools) to record live instruments, program synths and drum machines and loops, etc.  Your sound is your main concern; you don't need to worry about how to write it for other people to reproduce it, but instead, you just <em>do</em> it.  Finally, if you're composing a performance, you're creating an experience for the people who will join you in the space.  You're dreaming up interaction.  You could always be doing multiple of these.  As music director of an a cappella group, I need to compose both sheet music and performance, and occasionally recordings too.</p>
<p class="text">It's also important as a listener to understand these different products, especially the different amounts of abstraction used in each of them.  It's easy to get confused between the abstract music and the concrete sound.  For example, you might hear some masterwork played badly and conclude that the masterwork in question is boring or bad or something, when in reality a better performance would give the opposite impression.  You might hear a synthesized recording of some sheet music (like most of the audio examples in this book) and focus on the sound of the recording instead of the content.  Obviously both the sound and the musical content are important in life, but it would be wrong to confuse the two.</p>
<p class="text">People who aren't musically trained routinely make this mistake.  If you understand this, you'll save yourself a ton of trouble as a sheet music composer, and you'll also get a leg up as a recording composer.  If you think of a music video as an aspect of performance, you'll understand why some music becomes popular even if the recording doesn't sound that great.  When you compose sheet music, unless you find a group of musicians to play it (which you definitely should if you can), your only realization of the score will be synthesized.  So you go and show it to your friends.  What do they think?  "It sounds like videogame music."  I mean, yes it does, being synthesized and all, but that's not what was being asked!  People who aren't musically trained often don't know how to listen to the musical content of a piece of music.</p>
<h4 class="question">I sense some personal bitterness here...</h4>
<p class="text">Do you, now.  This whole book is built out of personal bitterness for people being wrong about music theory.  You knew this going in!</p>
<p class="text">On the flip side, you can understand much more easily how artists that one may not consider to be... musically sophisticated can be so popular.  People dig the sound.  They maybe also identify with the lyrics, or the sound might be simply something that appeals to their social groups.  We'll talk more later about why people may dig the sound.  Part of it is just familiarity.  They may even find the artists physically attractive, which leads them to enjoy the music on a romantic level, and, again, familiarity makes them enjoy the music even without the artists' hot bodies on a screen.  Non-musicians generally see music as a social phenomenon, not a musical one.  Your musical tastes are clues about who you are, who your people are, what you are like, stuff like that.  Popular music is not and has never been about the music itself.  Luckily, there are plenty of popular artists out there who are <em>ridiculously</em> talented, both at performing and at composing, so for our purposes of learning about the music itself rather than the social aspects, there's plenty of great popular music out there.  Much of the audience may care more about the sound than the musical content, but the musical content still has an effect, and you get a band like the Beach Boys or the Beatles who have that talent <em>and</em> that sound, and you can see why they've stood the test of time.</p>
<h4 class="question">Isn't this a bit elitist?  A lot elitist, actually?</h4>
<p class="text">Meh, kinda?  I want to emphasize that I don't think that people who like the sound of popular music are in any way <em>inferior</em>.  <em>I</em> like the sound of popular music.  It's popular for a reason.  I think that listening to music in other genres is not something everyone knows how to do, and maybe they ought to learn, but it's not my business whether they do or not; I'm just here to tell <em>you</em> what to do, you who are reading this book on purpose for this very reason.  If other people want to keep doing what they've always done, that's great for them.  There's popular music out there that I don't personally enjoy, and there's plenty that I do enjoy.  I like listening to rap.  Some people don't.  I'm not, like, super into it, but I enjoy it.  On the other hand, I don't enjoy listening to Blink-182 or Mozart, most of the time.  No offense to Mark, Travis, and Tom (and apparently Matt and Scott too — but offense is definitely meant to Wolfgang); I just don't like some of their music.  I can rant about how much I don't like some of their pieces and grudgingly admit that I don't hate others of their pieces, but I'll spare you all that.  We all like the music we like, and there's no judgment there.</p>
<h4 class="question">...But?</h4>
<p class="text">Heh heh, you said "but"!  But there's no "but".</p>
<h4 class="question">Oh, come on.  From everything you've written so far, you clearly love big "but"s.  Don't lie.</h4>
<p class="text">No, I'm serious.  Some music may not be very... sophisticated, but that doesn't make it bad music.  <em>I</em> may not enjoy it, or, who knows, maybe I'll love it!  I can't tell you to enjoy or not enjoy anything.  I can only tell you what I like or don't like, and you can make your own decisions.  This goes back to <? sectionLinkShort('zero'); ?> about what you can and can't write.  Music theory is just a set of tools.  How you use those tools is up to you.</p>
<p class="text">Finally, there's one more reason to talk about composition products now: we need to set our assumptions straight.  You will find, if you look on YouTube or elsewhere, <em>plenty</em> of guides for making music or music theory in general, from <em>plenty</em> of different perspectives.  This book is just one more of those.  I like to think that it fills a niche that the others miss, but those other people — well, some of them — are <em>incredibly</em> knowledgeable about music theory.  But what they say may not apply to you if you pick different assumptions.  A great example is the focus on improvisation and what scales to play over what chords.  You see this all the time.  If you're trying to learn jazz improvisation, then yeah, that's directly applicable, but if you aren't, well... it's still applicable, just maybe less directly.  You have to filter it through your assumptions and their assumptions.  Their assumption is often that you're playing a solo instrument (often, guitar) in a jazz combo of some sort, and the chords are given to you and played by the rhythm section, including a bass that's always playing the root of the chord.  You can play rootless chord voicings, for example, because the bass has the root.  Well, if you <em>aren't</em> in a jazz combo, you probably don't have a bass playing the root, and you probably don't even have a melody, so what are you doing improvising?  The scales recommended in the jazz idiom may completely not apply to you, either.  Jazz uses the mM7 chord a lot, for example, but maybe you don't want to do that because it's, you know, very distinctive and doesn't fit the sound you're going for.</p>
<p class="text">In particular, you need to be aware of the differences between your product and the product of the people from whom you're learning.  If you're a sheet music composer or your product is a performance, worrying about filters and effects is not relevant to you, and if your product is a recording, you don't need to worry about the acoustics in every part of the space and whether you need to perform any differently to be heard throughout — but you do need to worry about the acoustics of the studio, if you're recording live audio.  You don't need to worry about whether other people (outside of your own group) will be able to understand your instructions either, because they don't have any sheet music or instructions in the first place.</p>
<p class="text">As we continue our journey into music theory, we'll make more assumptions, and we'll sometimes relax our assumptions too.  It's good to get into the habit of checking those whenever we can.  For example, a lot of the music theory we've done so far and will do in the future centers around the extremely basic assumption that we're working in 12-tone equal temperament.  Well, <em>what if we're not</em>?  What changes?  Maybe we're assuming that we're working with professional instrumentalists when we write those crazy runs, but what if we're working with amateurs who can play reasonably well but not that well?  Or middle school students?  Is the music <em>ready</em> for your assumptions to be shattered somehow?</p>
<p class="text">This assumption problem is a big deal in the world of recording attribution.  Say you have a recording of the first movement of Beethoven's 5th Symphony in C minor, played by the New York Philharmonic, conducted by Leonard Bernstein.  Who is this piece of music by?  Beethoven, obviously.  Right?  So if you play Symphony No. 5 by Beethoven, that's this recording, right?  Of course not.  It's only the first movement.  Symphonies generally have multiple movements; Beethoven's 5th has four (it's a very standard symphony, other than the <em>attacca</em> between the later movements).  So you really should say that the title is Symphony Nº5 in Cm, Op. 67 – I. Allegro con brio; artist Ludwig van Beethoven.  Maybe you could just write Beethoven, but if someone groups pieces by artist, will these two artist names be together?  Of course, this is still not enough, because many orchestras have played this piece (it's probably the most famous piece of orchestral music in the world).  Even sticking the conductor's name isn't enough; Bernstein conducted it with the New York Philharmonic <em>and</em> the Vienna Philharmonic.  I don't know what Bernstein's history with this piece in the New York Phil might have been, but it's entirely possible that there have been numerous performances of this piece by the New York Philharmonic under Leonard Bernstein, featuring different musicians on different days; there might even have been multiple recordings of the same performance from two different sets of microphones in the same room.  In contrast, there are all of three versions of DMX's Ruff Ryders' Anthem: the regular album version and the radio edit (if you're familiar with the original version, you should check out how DMX handles all the censored words; it's hilarious, especially in the music video), as well as a remix by DJ Clue?, but never mind that one.  The artist is DMX.  Yeah, his band was there; his posse was saying "what" at the end of every bar; there was a producer (Swizz Beatz) and songwriters (Kaseem Dean along with DMX himself).  All these people are important, sure, but they don't identify the recording.  All you need to know is that this is DMX – Ruff Ryders' Anthem (uncensored).  The standard [artist] – [title] labeling scheme with two pieces of information <em>only works when the product is a recording</em>.  When the product is a performance, there are now three< identifying pieces of information: the artist, the title, and the performance details (artists sometimes sell live albums of specific concerts, for example).  And when the product is sheet music, there are not <em>four</em> pieces: the composer, the performer, the performance details, and the title.  If you view the performance details as somewhat extraneous, which is fair, you still have to deal with two totally separate artists, the composer and the performer.</p>
<p class="text">The problem isn't even limited to classical music.  Are you familiar with Miles Davis's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsp5OASh7bg">Autumn Leaves</a>?  Great recording.  Except that the song is obviously Les Feuilles Mortes by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWfsp8kwJto">Yves Montand</a>.  By which I mean it's by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autumn_Leaves_(1945_song)">Joseph Kosma and Jacques Prévert</a> (English words by Johnny Mercer, but the French words are much prettier).  Jazz standards (using "jazz" <em>very</em> broadly here) work differently from the three products we've discussed; they're something in between folk songs and sheet music.  Folk songs are sung by non-musicians, but jazz standards are performed by musicians.  A jazz standard may have some canonical version, maybe from the first movie it was featured in (if it was featured in a movie), like the Yves Montand recording I linked, but other musicians will also play the tune, making it their own, like Miles Davis did.  I've heard a whole lot of versions of Les Feuilles Mortes; I knew this song in French as a kid (my Egyptian grandparents spoke French).  None of those versions were the first Yves Montand or the Miles Davis.  And while every recording of Beethoven 5 will clearly state that this is a piece by Beethoven, you'll have to dig deep into the liner notes to find Kosma's and Prévert's names anywhere on an Autumn Leaves recording.  You additionally will have to search for an arranger's name when the credit goes to the solo singer.</p>
<p class="text">Modern classification systems have attempted to fix the problem.  The Leonard Bernstein conducts Beethoven CD set <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beethoven-Symphonies-Violin-Concerto-Overtures/dp/B003S0IJWA">on Amazon</a> (the New York Philharmonic recording) has the following list of artists: "Ludwig van Beethoven (Composer), Leonard Bernstein (Conductor), New York Philharmonic (Orchestra), Isaac Stern (Performer), Martina Arroyo (Performer), Regina Sarfaty (Performer), Nicholas Di Virgilio (Performer), Normal Scott (Performer), The Julliard Chorus (Performer)".  The additional performers are vocal soloists in Beethoven 9 (which features a chorus); Isaac Stern is the violin soloist in one of the additional Beethoven pieces in the collection, the Violin Concerto in D major.  But that's a <em>lot</em> of information to just carry around in a title.  The way we think about commercial music is still with one artist and one title, and that artist is going to be the composer for a classical piece and the performer for a jazz piece, leaving the classical performer and jazz composer out in the lurch.  Commercial music is very much optimized for the recording as a product, not sheet music or performance or even jazz standards or folk songs.</p>
<p class="text">I also want to get a little bit of basic terminology out of the way:</p>

<h3 class="subsection-title" id="types">8.1.6 Composition Types</h3>

<p class="text">There are various levels of originality that one can have when composing, and we tend to approach them differently.  A <em>composition</em> is generally a completely original piece of music.  You write the chords, the melodies, everything.  An <em>arrangement</em> is a piece of music based on another work that recontextualizes it somehow; an example would be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aT9kG7o_SE">an orchestra playing Bohemian Rhapsody</a>.  A <em>transcription</em> is a <em>faithful</em> reproduction of a work in another medium; for example, in <? exampleLink('Fêtes'); ?> we saw Ravel's transcription of Debussy's Fêtes, originally an orchestral piece, for two pianos.  Oftentimes compromises need to be made in a transcription; there's just no way for two pianos to get every single note of the orchestral piece, so Ravel had to emulate textures only approximately.  It's really hard to repeat a chord in fast triplets on the piano, for example, so in the very first measure of that example you can see Ravel's solution in the Piano II part.  He keeps the rhythm intact, but instead of the same chord three times in the triplet like in the original, he has a different note in the middle.</p>
<p class="text">The above types of composition apply generally to music in less commercial genres.  In popular and electronic music, we have similar concepts: a <em>remix</em> is kind of like an arrangement, where elements of the original piece are often sampled and some new elements are added.  Sometimes there's no sampling at all and you should probably just call it an arrangement, but the industry calls it a remix so there we go.  A <em>cover</em> is analogous to a transcription; it's when a band plays another band's song.  The cover can be faithful, where the band really tries to get the details the same as in the original band's recording, or it can be more imaginative, adding some sort of twist to the original song.</p>
<p class="text">Just like with the product, there are in-between possibilities as well.  A remix or arrangement <em>is</em> the original piece, just in a transformed way.  A composition may be based on some pre-existing theme, for example, but still be very much its own piece.  This is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXze_TLUTqM">In Dulci Jubilo</a> (here on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_dulci_jubilo">Wikipedia</a>), a medieval German Christmas carol.  The video presents an arrangement of the song for choir; the choir is singing In Dulci Jubilo, in a setting written by someone (the video doesn't say who).  Here, on the other hand, is Norman Dello Joio's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnTiX4sBzQM">Variants on a Medieval Tune</a>, which is <em>not</em> In Dulci Jubilo but is based on it, sometimes rather loosely.  (I once played the alto clarinet solo on this piece.  Alto clarinet is <em>weird</em>.)  Dello Joio composed the piece around a pre-existing theme, but the point of the piece isn't to present the theme itself, so it's not an arrangement.  But it's not completely original either.  It's something in between.  There are <em>many</em> examples of this kind of thing, especially since folk songs became popular in the beginning of the 20th century.  Ethnomusicologists went around collecting folk songs, and composers would create tunes with those folk songs.  This is evident in music by Bartók, Grainger, Vaughan Williams, Holst, etc.  Even Tchaikovsky's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yAKENqmTT0">1812 Overture</a> is based on pre-existing themes, including Russian chorales and even bits of La Marseillaise.  Here's another fun one, Morton Gould's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eQh_yCqEWY">American Salute</a>, a set of variations on the Civil War song When Johnny Comes Marching Home.  Another possibility is the <em>medley</em>, which is just a bunch of snatches of songs stuck next to each other.  This can be done for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rGVXLNQ3dY">humorous effect</a>.  Or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YMHSqC63is">not</a>.  Medleys tend to have arranger credits rather than composer credits, with the composers of the individual pieces credited separately somewhere.  Medleys are also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni632sTHZWU">not limited to classical genres</a>!</p>
<p class="text">Each type of composition presents its own challenges.  The most creative of these is the full composition, since you need to come up with your own ideas.  We're going to talk about this a lot more in the coming sections.  Making a remix is often not hard at all if you're sampling the original (but be careful about licensing so you don't run afoul of copyright laws in your jurisdiction).  Making a cover, on the other hand, is fairly tough, especially since the song you're covering probably didn't make very precise sheet music.  Making a faithful cover involves very careful listening to figure out all of the parts of the original, and this can actually be very hard.  You may need to slow down the recording or even use spectrum analysis tools, if they're available.  It involves a lot of trial and error as well, because it can be tough to hear inner voices in chords, so you have to use music theory to figure out what chord it ought to be and check if you're right.  Transcribing a recording has the same set of challenges, but making a transcription from sheet music is quite easy.  If you've never composed anything, I recommend starting with a transcription of something.  It's essentially multiple-choice composition; you just have to pick who gets what line.  My first-ever composition was a wind orchestra transcription of a <a href="http://offtonic.com/music/band.php#fugaiv">Bach fugue</a>, which meant that I went through the original and decided which instruments would play which notes, but I didn't have to write any original notes of my own (except a bit in the percussion, I suppose).  Arranging is sort of in between transcribing and composing, and these days it's what I do most often, since my ensemble performs arrangements of well-known pre-existing songs rather than original compositions.  Arrangements can really run the gamut between faithful and imaginative; you can do pretty much anything between a free treatment of the material and a close transcription.  In my old group, MIT's Techiya, we spanned the gamut in our album <a href="https://mittechiya.bandcamp.com/album/technetium">Technetium</a>, with <a href="https://mittechiya.bandcamp.com/track/migdol-spring-2011-concert">Migdol</a> being a very close transcription of the Kol Achai original and <a href="https://mittechiya.bandcamp.com/track/erev-shel-shoshanim">Erev Shel Shoshanim</a> being far more free and imaginative.  I personally prefer the close transcription style for songs that have a particular reference recording that everyone knows and the imaginative style for folk songs; in this case, Migdol is a song by a group called Kol Achai, so the arrangement tries to capture most of the subtleties of that recording (I did take some liberties in a few places, though); Erev Shel Shoshanim is a famous folk song that everyone performs differently, so there was no reason to copy anyone in particular.  Other a cappella arrangers will have their own ways of approaching this issue.</p>
<h4 class="question">So...  When are we going to get to actually composing stuff?</h4>
<p class="text">Patience, patience!  But at least now we've gotten the product and type out of the way, so let's narrow our focus a bit.</p>

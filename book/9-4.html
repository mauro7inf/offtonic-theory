<p class="text">We've seen Roman numerals before.  They were briefly introduced in <? sectionLinkShort('basic chords diatonic'); ?> and used frequently since.  But we haven't really delved into how to properly label the harmonies in a piece of music, and that's what this section is all about.  It will be long, because there are lots of chords and situations to cover, but by the end of this section, you should be able to correctly stick I's and V's under the chords of any piece of music that uses functional harmony.</p>
<h4 class="question">Functional harmony is...?</h4>
<p class="text">...The kind of harmony that allows you to stick Roman numerals under it.</p>
<h4 class="question">Your definition is circular.</h4>
<p class="text">They usually are.  But once we understand the Roman numeral system and its limitations, we can gain an understanding of what that means.  Even so, we will run into some functional harmonies that Roman numerals weren't designed to handle.</p>

<h3 class="subsection-title" id="introduction">9.4.1 Introduction</h3>

<p class="text">Let's begin with an example.  I chose one of my favorite chorales, number 110 in the Bach chorale book.</p>
<h4 class="question">One of your favorites, is it?  Why do you like it so much?  Does the text speak to you?  Is the harmonization particularly creative?  I know how passionate you are about the Bach chorales.</h4>
<p class="text">...I opened up a JavaScript console and typed in <code>Math.floor(Math.random()*389)</code>, and it spat out <code>110</code>.  Actually, it spat out <code>256</code> first, but I didn't like that one as much so I went to the next one.</p>
<h4 class="question">Aha.  And what if you'd gotten 0?  What's chorale 0?</h4>
<p class="text">Dude, stop poking holes in my code, all right?  If I'd gotten 0, I'd just do chorale 389 and realize that I forgot to add 1.</p>
<h4 class="question">So you mean that this really should have been chorale 109, not 110?</h4>
<p class="text">This is <em>my</em> book and we're going to do whichever chorale <em>I</em> want to do, and the chorale <em>I</em> want to do is 110, now shut the fuck up.</p>
<p class="text">So.  Chorale 110.  It's one of four settings of the same tune, <a href="http://bach-chorales.com/BWV0248_28.htm">Gelobet seist du, Jesu Christ</a>, but this one is of a later verse, Dies hat er Alles.  You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gzOmPb-1yo">hear it with Bach's own score</a>!  You can also learn <a href="http://www.bach-cantatas.com/CM/Gelobet-seist-du.htm">far more than you ever wanted to learn</a> about the melody itself; the text is by Martin Luther and the melody is by Johann Walther, both dated to 1524.  Note that Bach was a very religious Protestant, living in Germany about 200 years after the Reformation, and most, if not all, of his chorale settings are from Protestant hymns.  (Interestingly enough, chorale 111 has a melody written by one Joh. Seb. Bach in 1725.  I wonder who that is.)  Let's analyze it:</p>

<? createExample('chorale 110'); ?>

<h4 class="question">Wow, <em>that's</em> weird.  Also, why does the bass sound different from the sheet music?</h4>
<p class="text">This is from Part III of Bach's Christmas Oratorio (it's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Oratorio#Part_III">number 28</a>), and Bach's original scoring includes a basso continuo part that's slightly different from the bass part of the chorale.  I added it to the recording but not to the sheet music since I didn't want to be confusing.  It just goes an octave lower at a couple of points; all of the actual notes are the same.</p>
<p class="text">As for the weirdness...  You can look at the information about the melody above, or you can just see it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelobet_seist_du,_Jesu_Christ">on Wikipedia</a>.  The thing to look for is the weird notation in the image on the sidebar, not the melody in modern notation.  If you can't read that, I'll briefly explain what's going on.  The image is public domain, so I'll include it below:</p>

<? createExample('walter gelobet'); ?>

<p class="text">The symbol at the start of the staff tells you where C is, in the second line from the top.  Counting down, then, the first note is a G, as well as the last note.  Given the range, if we remember our <? sectionLinkShort('other modes gregorian', 'Gregorian modes'); ?>, this hymn is in Mode VIII, hypomixolydian!  It isn't Gregorian chant; it uses much more advanced notation including a (mensural) time signature and a five-line staff.  But it maintains the modal framework of those pieces, and that means that the hymn is in a form of mixolydian, not major.  For Chorale 110, Bach transposes it up to A, and in measure 6, he adds a G# passing tone where the original melody lacks one — if it had one, it would be the b7 of the scale.  Bach, on the other hand, was writing squarely in the tonal framework of his time rather than the modal framework of the hymn tune, so he had to square the mixolydian feel of the melody with what by then was standard tonality.  The first clue that this is happening is the key signature: it looks like D major, but the piece begins and ends on an A major chord.  The key signature therefore suggests vestiges of A mixolydian.  The only occurrence of the b7 in the melody is actually hidden away: if you follow the melody of the hymn, you would expect that the A in the soprano in bar 8 would continue rather than go up to C#.  Instead, the A continues in the alto, and the alto then has that G natural that's the b7 in A mixolydian (along with some other rearranging of the original ending).  Because of this, the chorale has a very confused identity: is it in D or is it in A?  In the first half of the chorale, it clearly begins in D and clearly modulates to A.  We'll talk about modulation later in the chapter, but D has a G natural while A has a G#, and you can tell when the modulation happens by tracking its introduction.  The second half clearly continues in A, hammering on the dominant, but then, in bar 7, a very curious thing happens.  The G natural is reintroduced, which suggests D major, but measures 8 and 9 are <em>really</em> unclear about the key.  So, in my analysis, I included an optional modulation to D major, since you could really hear that entire second half in either D or A and I'm not prepared to pick just one.</p>
<p class="text">Since so many of Bach's chorales are based on Martin Luther hymns, his having to shoehorn a modal melody into a tonal context is fairly common among the chorales, and in many cases, the ending on a half-cadence is much clearer, as when a chorale is in the phrygian modes (Mode III or IV).</p>
<p class="text">So, let's get to the Roman numerals.  This is a preview of what we'll cover in this section, so if something's confusing, just hold on and we'll talk about it in more detail.</p>
<p class="text">Roman numerals indicate the scale degree in the key that's the root of a given chord.  Therefore, it only makes sense in the context of a key.  In the pickup to the chorale, the piece is announced: it's D major.  Major keys are written with capital letters, while minor keys are written with lowercase letters; if the key had been B minor, the analysis would have begun with "b:" instead.  There are several different ways to use Roman numerals, and different authors have different preferences.  My way, which I've been using in this book, is to label the root according to the major scale; in B minor, the D major chord is bIII, since D is the b3 in B major.  Other authors label relative to the scale, so D major would be III, since D is the third degree of B minor.  I find that this is confusing.  Also, I use uppercase numerals for major (and dominant) chords and lowercase for minor (and diminished) chords.  IV is the major chord on the fourth degree, regardless of the mode.  Other authors use uppercase numerals only.  (I've even seen some use an m for minor, so what I call the ii chord becomes the IIm chord, but that's not my style.)  The first chord of this piece was labeled V, which means that I analyzed it as a major triad on the fifth degree of the major scale.  We're in D, so this chord would be an A major chord.  It checks out.</p>
<p class="text">The second chord is V42.  4 2 is figured bass shorthand for 6 4 2.  The chord is G C# E A: the A is the 2, C# is the 4, E is the 6.  The root is still A.  This is an A7 chord in third inversion.  As you can see, we use figured bass shorthand notation to denote inversions, but we use Roman numerals to denote chordal roots.  The figured bass is obvious: look at the notes and just get the interval each one makes with the bass, which are 6, 4, and 2.  The Roman numeral, on the other hand, is an analysis: you need to look at the chord and figure out which note is the root.  It's not always trivial, and in some cases, authors will disagree.  That IV64 in the last measure that resolves to I, is it really a IV64 or is it a I with a double suspension, 6-5 and 4-3?  It's... obviously the double suspension.  They're even tied over.  But the IV64 is an individual enough sonority that I think it should be labeled as such, while other people entirely disagree and would label it I64—53 — the 64 doesn't refer to the inversion number but to the two suspensions.  Except that I64 should be a I chord in second inversion, not a root position I chord with suspensions.  It's confusing.  I think my way is <em>less</em> confusing.  You may disagree.</p>
<h4 class="question">Why do some eighth notes have chords but others don't?</h4>
<p class="text">Well, that's analysis too.  I had to decide whether the note was just a non-harmonic tone or whether the combination of non-harmonic tones was important enough to label.  If the confluence of voices is functional, I think it's useful to label it, but, again, you may disagree.  In the first measure, the introduction of the G natural radically changes the chord from a root position A to an A7 in inversion; it doesn't feel like a big change since the G is just a passing tone, but that dissonance exists on many levels and they all resolve as they should (well, the C# takes an extra beat, but it gets there).  On the other hand, in measure 1, the E passing tone in beat 1 in the bass is clearly non-harmonic.</p>
<p class="text">In measure 2, I opted to not bother about non-harmonic tones.  Technically, beat 2 has a 4-3 suspension in the tenor, which is generally notated, but I didn't feel like going to the trouble.  Interestingly, the second eighth note does <em>not</em> have the 7th, so I could have done some funky figured bass to accurately notate these chords.  But... why?  I don't need to capture every detail.  I don't <em>want</em> to capture every detail.  I only want to capture the important ones.  In figured bass, the composer needs to tell the performer what to play, but in analysis, we learn what we want to learn.</p>
<p class="text">In measure 3, we have a <em>modulation</em>, a change of tonal center.  This happens by means of a pivot chord: the chord on beat 3 can be interpreted as a vi in D or a ii in A, and the music continues with the latter interpretation as it launches into a ii - V - I in A major, followed quickly by another, vi - ii65 - V7 - I.  The ii - V - I is a strongly tonic-establishing progression, which is why Bach uses it pretty much all the time.</p>
<p class="text">In measure 5, the last eighth note, we have a V6/V.  This is a secondary dominant.  The chord is a B major chord in first inversion, and it wants to resolve to E major, the V in A.  The B major chord in first inversion is the V6 in the key of E, which is the V, so we write it as V6/V.</p>
<h4 class="question">Um, the bass note is B, not D#.  It's in root position.</h4>
<p class="text">No, the bass is on D#; the <em>tenor</em> is on B.  The voices cross.  Crossing with the bass voice is always annoying, because it changes the analysis to refer to a middle voice as the bass rather than the lowest voice.  In keyboard works, this is kind of irrelevant, but when you can follow the voices individually, you tend to hear the bass as the bass even if the tenor is currently lower.</p>
<p class="text">In measure 6 we have a IV6/V.  The same situation happens here: this A major chord, ordinarily a I, is actually acting in a IV - V - I cadence in E major, the V.  This <em>could</em> be a modulation, but I don't think the tonal center has changed; I hear that E as still the dominant rather than as a new tonic.  The reason why I chose this analysis is because V/V resolving to I is very weird; it makes more sense for a IV to be prolonging a V.</p>
<p class="text">Bar 7 is where the crazy begins.  The starting I chord reminds us that we're in A, not E, but E is on display for the first three chords, a I - V - I in E (so it's V6 - V65/V - V in A), but then the G natural comes back, so you could think about this as having modulated to D.  To me, D here is just tonicized by the V42/IV on beat 4, but then weird stuff happens in measure 8.  The V42/IV - V43/V - IV6 is normal, but then, that second chord is very strange: it's C# minor, in <em>second</em> inversion.  Second inversion for triads is a special case, here justified by the scalar lines in all voice parts.  This C# minor is a passing chord.  But as a passing chord, it still has function.  The next chord is a B dominant, the V of E, so C#m is the vi of E.  It makes more sense in A, I think, especially since vi64/ii is especially weird.  But the weirdness doesn't stop, because Bach in the fourth eighth note twists the knife by adding an E#.  So that B is actually the IV of F#m, the chord on beat 3.  Looking back, you can kind of justify the C#m as the v64 of F#m, followed by the IV(b7), the viio, and the i, all of F#m.  But... we're not in F#m.  We're in... I don't know, D or A, I guess.</p>
<p class="text">Bar 9 features part of a sequence.  The first two beats repeats almost exactly (only the last eighth note isn't exact) in the second two beats, but a step lower.  They also feature that G natural, in an E minor chord, which is the reason why I think D major is a reasonable key to be in at this point.  In A major, that chord is a v, which is not in A major, but it <em>is</em> in A minor.  We have two options when analyzing this chord: we could consider it a chromatically altered V, or we could consider it borrowed from the parallel minor, which is called <em>modal interchange</em>.  I prefer this option, because even though the v chord is rare in minor in tonal music (extended tonality is a different beast, but we're looking at Common Practice music here), the situation when it <em>does</em> come up is exactly this one, where the line containing the 7th degree of the minor scale is descending, causing the 7th to be lowered.  The alto here would be a great example of the descending A melodic minor scale if it had an F natural instead of an F#, but the descent into G is enough to make me think of the v as borrowed rather than altered.  That said, the Em does make more sense as a ii in D, which wouldn't involve any borrowing.  But then I wouldn't get to talk about modal interchange, so hey!</p>
<p class="text">If analyzed in A major, the piece ends in a <em>plagal cadence</em>, a cadence that goes IV - I (or similar).  This is in contrast to the <em>authentic cadence</em>, which goes V - I.  If analyzed in D major, the piece actually ends with I - V, which is a <em>half-cadence</em>.  Several of the Bach chorales end in half cadences, mostly because it's the simplest way to adapt a modal melody to Bach's rigid tonality, but also because these chorales are generally short single movements in much larger works, and the half-cadence can resolve in the downbeat of the next movement.</p>
<p class="text">Talking about cadences, the fermatas go where the cadences happen.  A <em>cadence</em> is a pause or resolution in the music, and this is important because the cadence doesn't have to be harmonic, and a V - I harmony doesn't have to be a cadence.  For example, from measure 3 into measure 4, we have V7 - I, but that's not a cadence because the music doesn't stop!  The cadential points are the fermatas.  In measure 2 we get a V - I authentic cadence in D; at measure 4 we get a V - I authentic cadence in A; at measure 6 we get either an authentic V - I in E or a V/V - V half-cadence in A (that was my choice when analyzing); at measure 10 we get a IV - I plagal cadence in A or a I - V half-cadence in D.  We'll talk more about cadences too.</p>
<p class="text">This (mostly) random chorale's analysis exemplified most of the main points I want to hit in this section.  That wasn't luck.  Well, it wasn't <em>just</em> luck.  The fact is that these features of a random Bach chorale are present in Western music <em>in general</em>, not just the Common Practice stuff, not just the classical stuff.  This chorale had a bit of weirdness, and as we move into the Classical and Romantic periods we start seeing some different chords added to the toolbox, but the way we do a Roman numeral analysis is going to be basically the same for any genre.</p>
<h4 class="question">If it's the same for other genres, why are we analyzing Bach chorales in the first place?</h4>
<p class="text">Bach chorales — not all of them, but many of them — are extremely dense, harmonically; they're easy to analyze because of the mostly homophonic texture (all voices tend to move together in quarter notes except when they don't); they have modulations and weird stuff and cadences; they're <em>short</em>; etc.  I think Bach's chorales are boring.  I love his fugues and a lot of his other work, but the chorales are just not very interesting to me.  Still, doing a Roman numeral analysis on a chorale is easy, the piece is short, and there's a lot of stuff there to learn.  It also demonstrates the principle that analysis doesn't have to be boring even if the piece is boring.</p>
<p class="text">So let's get to the Roman numerals!</p>

<h3 class="subsection-title" id="root-position-triads">9.4.2 Root Position Triads</h3>

<p class="text">There are (at least) two ways to think about Common Practice harmony: as individual, invertible entities called chords, or as a confluence of voices over a bass voice.  The Roman numeral system mixes both.  It's good to understand where these chords came from.  Western music used to be <em>monophonic</em> — just one voice — back in plainchant times.  We've seen some plainchant in <? sectionLinkShort('other modes gregorian'); ?>.  Over time, before and going into the Renaissance, people started singing other notes along with the notes of the melody, and it was quickly discovered that some intervals sounded consonant while others sounded dissonant.  At first, only the octave and fifth were consonant, but eventually, the third, fourth, and sixth were also recognized as consonant.  So, assuming that the fourth and fifth are perfect consonances (augmented/diminished intervals are dissonant) and octaves/unisons are ignored, we can only have the following combinations of three different pitch classes: a bass note with a third and a fifth above it, a bass note with a third and a sixth above it, and a bass note with a fourth and a sixth above it.  The first is the 5 3 chord, the second is the 6 3 chord, and the third is the 6 4 chord:</p>

<? createExample('basic inversions'); ?>

<p class="text">All six chords have the same bass note, C.  The first two are 5 3 chords; the 5 must be a perfect fifth, but the third may be major or minor.  The next two are 6 3 chords; both intervals may be major or minor, but the interval between them must be consonant as well.  The last two are 6 4 chords; the 6 may be major or minor.  Those are all of the consonant chords that may be built on a C.  Actually, the 4 is not consonant above the bass, so we could eliminate the last two, the 6 4 chords; we won't, though, because they do appear as dissonant constructions.</p>
<p class="text">An interesting observation can be made about these chords: if you rearrange the notes, they <em>all</em> look like 5 3 chords, just with different bass notes!  If you move the 6 of a 6 3 chord down an octave (or move the other two up), it becomes the bass of a new chord with the same notes as the old one, and likewise, if you move the 1 of the 6 4 chord up, the 4 becomes the bass of this new chord.  These 5 3 sonorities come in two flavors, one with a perfect fifth and major third, and one with a perfect fifth and minor third, so we call the first one a <em>major triad</em> and the second a <em>minor triad</em>.  (There are other flavors of triad, but they're dissonant.)  We can then name the chords according to the bass of the 5 3, which we call the <em>root</em> of the chord, and the flavor.  The third chord has an A root and its third is minor, so it's an A minor triad.</p>
<p class="text">This leads to a dichotomy between the bass and the root.  In the first staff, the bass is C for all of the chords, but in the second staff, the roots vary.  The underlying assumption of Roman numeral analysis is that the most important of the two pieces of information is the root, so the third chord above is an A minor chord even though the bass is C.  The problem is, as we'll see, that other factors complicate things, because it's not always clear just what note the root happens to be.  Figuring out the root is actually a form of analysis; it's not just trivial labeling.  We need to understand the non-harmonic tones to properly understand what's actually in the chord.  For example, the fifth chord is an F major chord... unless it's a C major chord with 6-5 and 4-3 double suspensions.  We've already come across the major triad with the added 6th; as we'll see, it can also be an inverted 7th chord, so what's the real root?</p>
<p class="text">Assuming that we can resolve these questions (or, better yet, hoping that they just don't come up), we get to the main idea of Roman numerals: not only do we find the harmonic root of each chord rather than just the bass, we also figure out the root's place in the scale <em>and</em> how it functions according to the conventions of Common Practice music.  The word "function" is a bit overloaded.  We've briefly mentioned the phrase model that goes Tonic - Pre-Dominant - Dominant - Tonic (T - PD - D - T), and some use the word "function" to refer to its region in the phrase model.  This is a very limiting view, and also, the word "function" also applies to just the Roman numerals themselves.  These are the Roman numeral functions of the diatonic chords in major and minor (and phrygian dominant, because why not):</p>

<? createExample('major minor functions'); ?>

<h4 class="question">Why phrygian dominant?  Did Bach write chorales in phrygian dominant too?</h4>
<p class="text">He did not, but we care about far more than just Bach's music, I hope!  The other modes in regular usage other than major and minor are quite similar to major and minor, but phrygian dominant is not.  In several cultures' musics, including Spanish music and Ashkenazic Jewish music, major, minor, and phrygian dominant are the three principal modes.  In fact, the phrygian mode is more like phrygian dominant than like minor, for the most part, since the b2 leading tone works the same way in both modes and is their primary feature.</p>
<h4 class="question">Why does minor have so many more chords?</h4>
<p class="text">Because minor, as you'll remember, has a variable 7th degree, as well as a variable 6th degree on occasion.  There's some debate about which of these chords are truly diatonic to minor.  The chords without the raised 6th and raised 7th are obviously diatonic.  There's some debate about the V; some say it is diatonic and some not, depending on the definition of "diatonic" in use (the diatonic collection of C minor is the C natural minor scale, but if you use "diatonic" to refer to whether something is in the scale or not, that's a different story).  Chords with a raised 6th are even worse, because the raised 7th is in the harmonic minor scale, used as a justification for including chords with a raised 7th, but the raised 6th is not.  I figured I'd just list all of them to be safe.</p>
<p class="text">So, the way this works is like this: the triads in a key have functional names based on two things: their scale degree and their flavor.  Just like the minor triad on A is an A minor triad, the minor triad on scale degree 6 is vi.  The Roman numeral corresponds to the scale degree of the <em>major</em> scale, so the major triad on the 6th scale degree of the minor scale, which is the b6, is bVI.  The Roman numeral is uppercase for major triads and lowercase for minor triads.  Some triads have a minor third and a diminished fifth; these dissonant triads are said to be <em>diminished</em>, and they get lowercase numerals and a little circle.  I prefer to write it in text as viio, but it's more proper to write vii°.  Trouble is, as we'll see very soon, sometimes the little o gets a slash through it; there's an easily available keyboard symbol for ø but not for... the little circle with a slash, which I can't write.  For consistency, I just call it viio.  Some other triads have a major third and an augmented fifth; these are also dissonant, and the general symbol is a +, but I prefer to just write #5 (because I can't get Sibelius to display a regular plus sign).  In text, I'll write bIII+ instead of bIII#5, but in analysis, the #5 is probably more useful.  (Note that the little dash under the # in the symbols is because Sibelius is very weird about Roman numeral notation; it's a workaround in order to — get this — advance the cursor, because otherwise, the # and the 5 get written in the same location, one on top of the other, and the little dash is the only thing I've found that advances the cursor.  Even the Sibelius support people couldn't help with that one.)</p>
<p class="text">These functions can be combined with the inversion numbers to be more specific about a chord.  A Roman numeral without any numbers is by default in the 5 3 form; a Roman numeral with a 6 is in 6 3 form; a Roman numeral with a 6 4 is in 6 4 form.  For example, if we're in C major and we play an F in the bass with a 6 3 above it, the notes are F A D, which is a D minor triad in the 6 3 inversion.  D is the second degree of C major, so it gets a 2 of some sort; it's minor, so it's lowercase; it's in 6 3 form, so it gets a 6.  This chord is therefore ii6.  Let's do another: suppose we're in G minor and we play G with a #6 4 above it.  The notes here are G C E — the E is natural, because the sharp raises it from the Eb.</p>
<h4 class="question">Why not a natural?</h4>
<p class="text">The accidentals in inversion numbers are relative to the key, not absolute names.  Anyway, G C E is a C major triad in the 6 4 inversion.  C is the fourth of G, the triad is major, and it's in the 6 4 position, so the chord is IV64.</p>
<h4 class="question">But minor has a minor iv, right?</h4>
<p class="text">Well, if you look, it has both.  But maybe we're not <em>really</em> in minor.  Maybe we're in dorian.  Or it's a kind of amorphous mode.</p>
<p class="text">Here's where I need to call out a BIG caveat:</p>
<p class="text">EVERYBODY DOES ROMAN NUMERALS DIFFERENTLY.</p>
<h4 class="question">You've <em>gotta</em> be kidding me.</h4>
<p class="text">Nope.</p>
<h4 class="question">Fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu...</h4>
<p class="text">Rage comics?  Man!  That meme's <em>way</em> too old.</p>
<h4 class="question">Yeah, but by the time people read this, it will be fresh again, but ironically.  But FUCKIN' EXPLAIN YOURSELF.</h4>
<p class="text">Right.  So, you know what I said about Roman numerals being uppercase or lowercase depending on the flavor?  SOME PEOPLE DO THEM ALL UPPERCASE (and they don't bother with the diminished symbol, either).  Remember when I said that the scale degrees are relative to the major scale?  SOME PEOPLE JUST DO THEM TO THE SCALE IN QUESTION.</p>
<h4 class="question">WHY?  Just to confuse n00bz?  Not that <em>I'm</em> a n00b.</h4>
<p class="text">It's just what makes sense to different people.  (And the YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTUtqcDkzw7bisadh6AOx5w">12tone</a> does IIm instead of ii.  Also different.)  I actually was taught in college with the all uppercase, relative to its own scale system.  There's a benefit to this.  In music that behaves "normally", the extra information is not needed.  I already know that II is minor in a major key (the ii), and I already know that VI built on the b6 in a minor key (the bVI).  Why do I need to specify the type of chord explicitly, and why would I assume the major scale for music in minor?  But as soon as much starts to get more interesting, this system starts breaking down.  What happens if you're in a major key but you use the bVI chord from minor?  Is it the VI?  Some authors just call it the VI.  One book I've read calls it the bVI, but in minor, the same chord is the VI.  The problem is that mode is fluid in modern music and in extended tonality, and a system that's locked to the major/minor way of thinking will break down much sooner than one that isn't.  Other people have their preferences, but I like to do things the way I'm showing you because the system is flexible.  But if you grew up with another system, you'll probably think <em>that's</em> better for some probably good reasons.</p>
<p class="text">The important thing is that you realize that different people will give you roughly the same information in different forms.  We'll all agree on the content but the language may be a bit different.</p>
<h4 class="question">So what <em>are</em> these functions?</h4>
<p class="text">Let's explore them with some simple examples:</p>

<? createExample('functions 1'); ?>

<p class="text">The I and i chords are the tonic.  This is the "home" chord.  The I and i chords are generally at rest, but the rhythm and melody may be such that it still has someplace to go.  I and i are commonly used to both begin and end phrases, as you can see in measures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9.  When in first inversion (6 3), it's usually weaker and serves a more middle-of-the-phrase purpose.</p>
<p class="text">The V chord is the dominant.  It contains the 7 leading tone of the scale, which wants to go up to 1; since the 7 has a specific tendency and a directionality, we call it an <em>active tone</em>.  Dissonances are also generally active tones, whether harmonic dissonances like 7ths or non-harmonic tones.  It's generally a bad idea to put too much emphasis on active tones, because they call so much attention to themselves already that the sound becomes unbalanced.  In a four-voice texture, don't double an active tone if you can help it.  It's used in first inversion in measures 2 and 4, but it could easily have been in root position instead.</p>
<p class="text">The viio chord is the leading tone chord, and it's basically a dominant.  The 7 wants to resolve to 1 and the 4 wants to resolve to 3; the viio chord is dissonant on its own and generally wants to resolve.  The 4 doesn't need to resolve that badly, and the viio chord can also go to iii sometimes.  The viio chord rarely appears in root position (5 3 form), mainly because it doesn't sound good to have a dissonant active tone in the bass.  When the leading tone is in the bass, the chord is usually a V6 instead.  You can see the viio6 in measures 5, 7, and 9; it leads to iii in measure 8 and to I6 and i6, respectively, in measures 6 and 10.  The viio6 is useful when the bass is on the 2 and a dominant is required, since the V chord would need to be in the dissonant and unbalanced second inversion (but a V43 chord is another option; we'll talk about that one in a bit).</p>

<? createExample('functions 2'); ?>

<p class="text">The ii and iio chords are the supertonic, and the IV and iv chords are the subdominant.  All of them tend to set up the dominant (the ii and iio especially since they're a fifth above it), the V (or viio), so we call them <em>pre-dominant</em> (see measures 1, 3, 5, and 7, as well as in <? exampleLink('functions 1'); ?>, measures 1 and 3).  Sometimes they don't.  Actually, that's true for all of these chords: sometimes they don't do what you think they probably should.  In pop music, IV - I and iv - I are quite common (measures 10 and 12), but in classical music, these chords go to the V, not the I.  The ii and IV are quite similar especially when the ii is in first inversion, and they can be sort of interchangeable in the pre-dominant position.  The ambiguous conglomeration of these two chords is called the <em>ii-IV complex</em>.</p>

<? createExample('functions 3'); ?>

<p class="text">The vi and bVI chords (the submediant) sometimes behave like a tonic chord, as a resolution for the V (measures 2 and 4), and sometimes like a pre-dominant chord, going into the V (<? exampleLink('functions 2') ?> measures 9 and 11).  The vi and bVI are also a fifth above the ii or iio, so they also serve as pre-pre-dominants (measures 9 and 13).  The vi in major especially serves as an alternate tonal center for variety, since it's the relative minor of the I (measure 6).</p>
<p class="text">The iii chord (mediant) is fairly rare; when it shows up, it's usually a variant of the tonic (measure 23 versus 21), but <em>sometimes</em> it could be a variant of the dominant (measures 25 and, in minor, 27).  The bIII chord in minor is a very frequent alternate tonal center, as the relative major of the i chord (measure 20), but it doesn't have much of a function relative to the i.  The iii in major also shows up as an alternate tonal center (measure 18).  Since the iii is a fifth above the vi, it can also go that way (measures 8 and 12), or, commonly, to the IV as a substitute for the vi (measure 23 into 24).  The bIII doesn't really share these tendencies.  (Note that the viio chord also goes to iii the same way that iii goes into vi and iio goes into V, and this lessens the unbalance of having it in root position.)</p>
<p class="text">The bVII chord is the subtonic.  It's fairly rare in Common Practice music, but in pop music, it's usually a dominant, going up to the i or I (measure 15).  When it shows up in Common Practice, it's usually going to the bIII (measure 12), but then, it's actually the V in the key of the bIII, not the bVII.  We'll look at the difference shortly!</p>
<h4 class="question">What's the deal with that first Roman numeral in bar 27?</h4>
<p class="text">That's a bIII+ in first inversion.  In pop notation we'd actually just call it a V7b13, but I wanted to illustrate it here.  bIII6 would be the regular bIII major triad in first inversion, but this one is augmented.  The raised note is the third above the bass, so it gets a #3, but in figured bass notation, we don't actually have to write the 3 (though we certainly can), so the sharp hangs out by itself.  An accidental by itself in a figured-bass-type figure always refers to the third above the bass.  Note that it's not the third of the <em>triad</em>, because here, the third is in the bass.</p>
<p class="text">This example also features two V7's.  We'll talk about these shortly; for now, you can think of the F's in the tenor as passing tones.  Measures 7-10 and 11-14 are sequences: note that the material in the first measure repeats exactly in the second, third, and fourth measures, but down a step each time; the only difference is that they follow the diatonic notes of the scale.  This sequence in particular is sometimes called the <em>circle of fifths sequence</em>, since the roots simply go down a fifth each time.  We'll talk more about sequences later.</p>

<? createExample('functions 4'); ?>

<p class="text">The v is the minor dominant, and it's relatively uncommon in Common Practice music, but it does show up.  The way we've been thinking about minor, we raise the 7th over a V chord and we raise the 6th when necessary to avoid augmented seconds, but the way we think of minor <em>melodically</em> is that the 7th is raised when the melody is ascending, requiring the raised 6th, and it's lowered back when the melody is descending, requiring the lowered 6th (measures 13 and 18, measure 26 in the alto).  If a descending melody needs to be harmonized, that b7 will need a chord, and the v contains the b7 and is usually the best chord for the job, especially if the b7 is in the bass (measure 1), when the bVII might cause parallels and the bIII would be in the dissonant 6 4 position.  In pop music and extended tonality, the v could go to i like a regular dominant (measure 4).</p>
<p class="text">Along the same lines, the ii, IV, and vio chords are used only occasionally in Common Practice when one of the voices has that raised 6th and needs to be harmonized (measures 21, 23, 25).  The bIII+ is also rare and it's dissonant anyway, so it might happen as a momentary sonority between other sounds (measure 19, <? exampleLink('functions 3'); ?> measure 27), and not as its own important chord with an important function.</p>
<p class="text">In this example, there are quite a few scalar lines in minor.  The ii, IV, and vio chords can harmonize ascending scalar lines with the raised 6th, while the bIII, v, and bVII can harmonize descending ones with the lowered 7th.  The bass in measures 1 and 2 is descending; the soprano and alto in 13-20 are descending; the soprano is ascending in 21 and 22, the alto is ascending in 23 and 24, and in measures 25 and 26, the bass and tenor are ascending while the soprano and alto are descending.  Scalar lines tend to override harmonic function, so even though, for example, you wouldn't see a ii chord in minor, in measure 23 you do because the scalar line requires it.  The fun bit is at 26, when the ascending B natural and descending Bb happen at the same time, causing a cross-relation and creating that delicious diminished octave between the bass B and the alto Bb (well, it's two octaves, but who cares).  It's one of my personal favorite sounds.  Do note, though, that the raised 6th should continue on to the raised 7th in Common Practice music; the ii, IV, and vio chords aren't used otherwise — you just get iio, iv, and bVI.  In modern music, especially in dorian, these chords are very popular, but not so much in Common Practice.</p>
<p class="text">Also in this example, in measures 5-12, is another sequence.  This one goes down a fourth and up a second, and some call it the <em>Pachelbel sequence</em> because the first three bars of it show up in Pachelbel's famous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bm3JNk7pdzk">Canon in D</a>.  In measures 13-20, the same sequence is repeated in minor.  Notice how the two upper voices simply move down by step each time, taking the descending melodic minor notes, but the tenor descends by leap.  At the end of the sequence, the B in the bass is natural since it's leading up to the C.  This makes the other B in the chord also natural, and since the pattern has the tenor hold the note for the entire bar, the B in the Eb chord is natural as well, leading to a rare use of the bIII+.  In practice, though, nobody really uses the sequence beyond the first few iterations.  Again, we'll talk more about sequences later.</p>

<? createExample('functions 5'); ?>

<p class="text">In phrygian dominant, everything is different.  The I is still the tonic, but now the most active tone is the b2, leading down to 1, so the chords containing the b2 tend to be the dominant equivalents: bII (measures 1 and 8), vo (measures 5 and 12), and bvii (measures 3, 9, and 15).  While the active tone in a V chord is the 7, rising to 1, the active tone in the vo is the b2, descending to 1.  (v doesn't really have any active tones, but in modern music in aeolian, the b7 functions as a leading tone.)  The b2 as an active tone is actually problematic because doubling it is extremely awkward.  Two b2's going to 1's makes for parallel octaves, and if one of those b2's goes to 3 instead, it's an augmented second.  The b6 is also somewhat active and resolves to the 5, which is <em>also</em> problematic because a b2 and a b6 will result in parallel fifths in a bII chord (measures 1 and 8).  This is one of those times when I just said fuck it, let's leave the parallel fifths in.  Doubling the b2 results in parallel octaves; doubling the b6 results in parallel fifths; the only thing that can be safely doubled is the 4, and that can sound unbalanced because doubling the third often does.  I think the solution is to embrace the parallels.  Just gotta do it.</p>
<p class="text">The iv is the alternate tonal center in phrygian dominant, being the relative minor (measure 10).  It tends to alternate with the I rather than lead to a dominant equivalent.  The bVI also serves as an alternate tonal center, as the relative major (measure 19).  Recall that the third degree is variable in phrygian dominant (well, in the Spanish scale, anyway); while i is often heard as a change in mode to phrygian (measure 20), bIII and bVI do appear (measures 7, 18, 19).  bIII goes right into bII then I; in fact, iv - bIII - bII - I is called the <em>Andalusian cadence</em> (measures 7 and 8 — note the parallel fifths), probably because it's used all over the place in Andalusian music.  The bVI+ (measure 12) and iiio (measure 15) are more occasional sonorities in subtler, more contrapuntal passages, while the bVI can be a pre-dominant (measure 20) if used in the right way.</p>
<p class="text">This example had some 7th chords too.  Again, we'll get to them soon.  Also, the Roman numeral system was really not built for music in phrygian dominant (well, the Spanish scale, since we're using the variable third degree).  We use capital letters for major keys and lowercase for minor, but what do we use for phrygian dominant, which is a minor-type scale with a major third?  I prefer to just treat it as minor.  Luckily, the chords aren't any different... mostly.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.</p>

<h3 class="subsection-title" id="sixth-chords">9.4.3 Sixth Chords</h3>

<p class="text">Next up, sixth chords.</p>
<h4 class="question">Ah, like C6 or Em6?</h4>
<p class="text">No.  First inversion chords are known as sixth chords.  The C6 and Em6 are better thought of as <em>added</em>-sixth chords, which is an important but subtle distinction.  Added sixth chords are also 6 5 chords... but, right, we're getting there.  Here are the sixth chords (they're the same as the root position chords, just... not in root position):</p>

<? createExample('sixth chords'); ?>

<h4 class="question">So wait, they're the same chords, just inverted?  What's the big deal?</h4>
<p class="text">In modern harmonic analysis, we think of a chord and its inversions as being roughly the same thing.  That's not how these chords were thought of historically, and if we are to properly understand and use them, we shouldn't think of them that way either.  The reason is that root position chords are very strong and aurally stable, with the bass being the gravitational center of the chord that the other notes want to be stable with.  The fifth is the most stable interval after the unison and octave; the sound of the fifth pulls other notes into the potential well of sound that is the chord.  In a sixth chord, the bass no longer has that power.  Sixth chords are therefore relatively weak and ambiguous, with the bass asserting itself as a root versus the actual harmonic root of the chord.  The music doesn't feel resolved on a sixth chord.</p>
<h4 class="question">Why use the chord if it's weak?</h4>
<p class="text">Why do we have soft music and loud music instead of just loud music?</p>
<h4 class="question">We don't have soft music, what are you talking about?</h4>
<p class="text">Oh no, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness_war">Loudness War</a> has gotten to you!  But you know what I mean.  The strong and weak chords provide harmonic contrast, like the celery with your nuclear hot wings.  And also the voice leading sometimes works much better that way, and some chords actually sound better not in root position.  Let's go through them.</p>

<? createExample('sixth functions 1'); ?>

<p class="text">The I6 and i6 chords tend to serve to prolong the tonic.  Rather than being final and at rest, a first inversion tonic chord feels like things are continuing.  An arrival on a I6 or i6 is a weak arrival (measures 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 12, <? exampleLink('functions 1'); ?> measures 6 and 10, <? exampleLink('functions 3'); ?> measure 21) and is not generally used to finish a piece of music, but rather, it's an intermediate arrival.  I6 and i6 are the default options to harmonize a 3 or b3 in the bass, since the iii and bIII (and bIII+) are less related to the tonic and therefore somewhat destabilizing.</p>
<p class="text">The V6 chord is the default option to harmonize a 7 in the bass (measures 9, 11, 13, 15, <? exampleLink('functions 1'); ?> measures 2 and 4), and it works just like any other dominant but is weaker.</p>
<p class="text">The viio6 chord is a common option to harmonize a 2 in the bass when it goes 1 2 3 (<? exampleLink('functions 1'); ?> measures 5, 7, and 9, <? exampleLink('functions 3'); ?> measures 21 and 23) or 3 2 1 (measures 3 and 7), since the ii chord could create awkward parallels and ii - I is not a strong harmonic motion.  The viio chord tends to appear most often in first inversion, because the viio chord in root position sounds very unbalanced due to the 7 being an active tone in the bass that has a dissonance against it (the 4).  In a V7 chord, which we'll get to soon enough, the 4 has a strong tendency to resolve down and is actually the most active tone, with the 7, a consonance with the bass, less so.  The viio6 chord doesn't have a 5, which frees up the 4 to resolve up if it fits the music.  Therefore, the viio6 is also a great choice when harmonizing a melody with a 4 that goes up to 5.  The viio6 is not a strong dominant, but it's used quite frequently in situations where the dominant resolving to the tonic is a momentary thing and not a phrase ending.</p>

<? createExample('sixth functions 2'); ?>

<p class="text">ii6 (and iio6) are essentially substitutes of the IV (and iv) as pre-dominants (measures 3 and 7 versus measures 1 and 5).  The difference is tiny, but the sixth chord sounds weaker, and you often want that in a pre-dominant chord to set up the strong chords of the V - I.  IV6 (and iv6) substitute for the vi (and bVI) as pre-dominants (measures 11 and 15 versus measures 9 and 13), and this is a great thing because vi - V and bVI - V end up with awkward voice leading due to parallels, especially bVI - V, where the b6 going up to 7 is awkward with the augmented second.</p>
<p class="text">These examples may look simple, but man, I had to wrangle with them to get the awkward voice leading ironed out.  From measure 9 to 10, for example, the A can't go to the G because that's parallel octaves with the bass, and the E can't go to the D because that's parallel fifths with the bass.  The E therefore has to go up.  The E can't be doubled, either, because it can't go up in both instances, so we need to either double the A, which is OK, or the C, which is the third and is therefore less OK.  On the other hand, from measure 11 to 12, the A can be doubled but it doesn't have to be; the F or C can be doubled instead, and the F's have no restrictions on where it can go so long as they don't both go to the same place.  In measure 13 to 14, the situation is worse, because the Ab is an active tone and can basically only go down.  The Eb could go up to G, but it can't go to D.  Doubling the C sounds weird.  I ended up making the third chord a V7 to help alleviate some of the issues, and the Eb can just go up to the F; the weirdness, though, is that the doubled Ab goes down all the way to D, a tritone leap, and that melodically requires that the next step in that voice be in the opposite direction, so we end up with the voicing of the i in measure 14 with doubled root and third but no fifth.  Measure 15 to 16 was far easier since the F's were available.  I chose to make the 13-14 and 15-16 examples as similar as possible to illustrate the chord similarity, but really, I had a lot of options for 15-16 that I did not have with 13-14.  You'll find that using first inversion chords can help get around voice leading puzzles.</p>

<? createExample('sixth functions 3'); ?>

<p class="text">vi6 (and bVI6) are not particularly common chords, in part because they're too similar to the tonic.  When they come up (measures 2, 5), it could be because the voice leading led them that way or they're used as alternate tonal centers and are actually tonic sixth chords in a new key.</p>
<p class="text">iii6 and bIII+6 can be just alterations of the V chord (<? exampleLink('functions 3'); ?> measures 25 and 27), but they (and bIII, see measure 8) could just come up as a result of counterpoint doing its thing.</p>
<p class="text">The v6 generally harmonizes b7's in the bass (measure 9) and the bVII6 can harmonize 2's in the bass (measure 8).  v6 is especially common in descending bass lines in minor (<? exampleLink('functions 4'); ?> measure 1), since descending lines tend to use the lowered 7th.</p>
<p class="text">The other sixth chords are likely to show up in similar circumstances to their root position equivalents but in contrapuntal situations that end up with the third in the bass.  Since sixth chords are consonant (well, other than the diminished/augmented ones), there's no reason to avoid them, except that, for singers, they can be harder to tune if you're used to hearing the bass as the root of the chord.  But that aside, their weakness is attractive.  It's like a baby.  You want to hold it and play with it; you don't want it to push your car out of a ditch.  I mean, maybe <em>you</em> do.  You're weird.</p>
<p class="text">In this past example, measures 7 through 11 present a complete scale in a descending bass line (from 5 down to 5).  There's some other stuff going on, but from the F chord in bar 7 to the Ab chord in bar 10, every note in the bass is harmonized with a sixth chord (or a 6 5 chord), so we have a iiø65 to i6 to bVII6 to bVI65 to v6 to iv6 (with passing chords in between in some cases).  Sixth chords are very useful for parallel writing, since, if you voice the sixth above the third, you have no parallel fifths.  You still need to handle the fourth voice — or simply drop it for a few beats.  I chose to have an <em>ascending</em> scalar line in the soprano to balance the bass.</p>
<p class="text">At this point, you don't know enough to connect chords correctly, because we're focusing on analysis in this chapter as opposed to synthesis, but try doing what I did: come up with your own examples for each use of the diatonic chords in root position and in first inversion, and try to make them sound good and have no parallel fifths or octaves.  It's <em>much</em> easier said than done.  For most of these, I had to agonize a bit over how to voice the chords.  I know how these progressions typically go — I'm writing this book, after all — but the mechanics of actually voicing them is a kind of puzzle.  You have to consider where you need to go next, because it's quite possible to get stuck, especially in chords with directional 6ths in minor — the b6 wants to go down to the 5 and the raised 6th wants to go up to the raised 7th.  First inversion can make many of these problems less problematic because you're less beholden to the traditional doubling strictures.</p>
<h4 class="question">And what are those traditional doubling strictures?</h4>
<p class="text">In a root position triad, double the root.  If you need to, double the fifth.  If you really need to, double the third.  If you want to, omit the fifth entirely and triple the root.  If you <em>really</em> need to, double both the root and the third.  Do not skip the root or the third.  This really only applies to four-voice textures, though, so in any other situation, these guidelines go out the window.  Actually, if you don't like these guidelines, they go out the window too.  It's a matter of taste.</p>
<p class="text">In a sixth chord, you can really double anything.  You can omit the fifth, but it's common to double the fifth.  Doubling the third is common too; it doesn't unbalance the chord like doubling the third does in a root position triad.  The root is standard for doubling, but it's not actually a big deal to change it.  The reason is that the root position chord feels weird if it's not sonically strong, meaning a strong root, while the first inversion chord is not governed as much by its root or its bass, being more of a contrapuntal chord.</p>
<p class="text">In all cases, though, it's usually not a good idea to double active tones, like the 7 in any mode or the b6 in minor, or any chromatically altered tones unless a modulation has taken place.  The third is also more of a flavor tone than a meat-and-potatoes tone; just a pinch is enough to give taste to the chord.  And dissonant chords like diminished or augmented chords follow different rules entirely.  There certainly are exceptions.  We'll talk about this when we get to voice leading.  But for now, we have one triad inversion left:</p>

<h3 class="subsection-title" id="six-four-chords">9.4.4 Six-Four Chords</h3>

<p class="text">5 3 chords and 6 3 chords are used freely, with both types used for variety.  Of course, you can always do whatever you want, but in Common Practice where the functional harmony is stricter, the strong root position triads and the weaker but more interesting sixth chords are first-class citizens.  The 6 4 chord, on the other hand, is not.  The fourth with the bass is a dissonance.  If you think about it, a root position chord has the fifth above the bass, and the fifth, as we know, tonicizes the root of the interval.  If you have an F and a C, the C will tonicize the F.  You can omit the fifth from a root position triad, because the fact that it's the bass note will also tonicize the root of the chord, and the third implies the harmony of the triad, so we have everything we need in the chord, the root and the harmony.  In a first inversion triad, the fifth is between the upper members of the chord, so the bass is not tonicized and the root is.  But in a <em>second</em> inversion triad, the fifth is between the bass and another note, but the other note is the root.  The interval of the fifth feels upside-down, since the more stable note is above the less stable note, kind of like a pyramid standing on its point rather than on its base.  The "correct" resolution of the perfect fourth is to move it down, like a 4-3 suspension, but the 4-3 is predicated on an additional dissonance between the 4 and the 5 that the 6 4 doesn't have.</p>
<p class="text">So the 6 4 chord is in an interesting position: it's technically dissonant, but the intervals in the chord are only dissonant in context because the fourth is only dissonant above the bass due to how it turns the tonicization upside-down.  As a <em>sound</em>, it's not dissonant like a tritone or a second.  You can therefore use it when necessary without worrying too much, but if the dissonance of the fourth is showing, it has to be prepared and resolved appropriately or it will sound like bad voice leading.</p>
<p class="text">Here are the 6 4 chords in major, minor, and phrygian dominant:</p>

<? createExample('six four chords'); ?>

<h4 class="question">The augmented ones are weird.</h4>
<p class="text">Yes, especially since the altered note is the 1.  In text I'll just write something like bIII+64.  In figured bass, it would just be an altered note with a 6 4 under it, but since in Roman numeral notation we notate the root rather than the bass, we have to specify it here.  Actually, we <em>don't</em> have to specify it here.  We don't have to specify it at all.  We could go the route of using only uppercase numerals and letting the reader figure out the flavor of the chord from context.  We need to understand why we're doing this at all.  We're not writing performance instructions, and we're not trying to encode the sheet music into compact symbols.  We're doing <em>analysis</em>, and that means that we're writing down the important information so that we can discover patterns.  Not all of the information is important when exploring for harmonic patterns.</p>
<p class="text">Let's see these buggers in action.</p>

<? createExample('six four functions 1'); ?>

<p class="text">All that stuff I said about how unstable the 6 4 chords are in a mostly consonant sense?  It doesn't apply for diminished or augmented chords.  Those are <em>always</em> dissonant, in any inversion.  The viio64 in particular can be used relatively freely (well, you'll want to resolve the dissonance, but other than that).  It's not awkward at all.  The augmented chords are awkward in any inversion because they're augmented, but they're not any worse for being in second inversion.  It's only the consonant chords that get different when in the 6 4 position.  We can understand this in part by thinking of a diminished triad as a subset of a diminished 7th chord; no matter what inversion the diminished 7th chord is in, it's still the same diminished 7th chord (Bdim7 is the same as Ddim7 is the same as Fdim7 is the same as G#dim7, up to enharmonics), so if you change the inversion of the triad, say from Bdim in first inversion to Bdim in second inversion, you're just changing a Ddim7 with missing b5 to an Fdim7 with missing b3.  With augmented chords, it's even simpler, because an inverted augmented triad is the <em>same</em> augmented triad.</p>
<p class="text">The viio64 is just a dominant, and it's a good choice for when you want a dominant over a 4 in the bass (measures 1 and 3).  You generally wouldn't double the 7 because it's an active tone, but you can totally double the 4 (measure 1) or the 2 (measure 3).</p>
<h4 class="question">Why did you change the voicing between measure 1 and measure 3?</h4>
<p class="text">Doubling the 3 in the first chord of measure 1 sounds nice because the 3 is stable, but in a bIII+ chord, the b3 is less stable due to its tendency towards the 2, so in measure 3 I decided to double the 5 instead, which necessitated changing the rest of the voicings.</p>
<p class="text">Measure 5 has a bvii64, from phrygian dominant.  In phrygian dominant, the vo, bvii, and bII are all equivalent as dominants, so even though bvii64 is in second inversion, it doesn't sound very different from any other dominant, since the root is not particularly important.  The chord sounds no different from a bII6 or a vø42.  A similar thing happens in measure 7, where vo64 is no different from any other dominant in this mode.</p>
<p class="text">The iio64 sounds no different from other positions of the iio chord (measure 11), while the ii64 is more awkward than its inversions (measure 9)</p>
<p class="text">The remaining diminished chords (vio64 in measure 13, iiio64 in measure 15) are already only occasional sonorities, so they too are not changed by being in second inversion.</p>
<p class="text">The bIII+64 has a 7 in the bass, which generally has to go to 1, else it would have been a b7.  This makes it awkward to find a use for this chord, but the happy fact is that you don't have to ever use it if you don't want to.  In measure 18, the bIII+64 is used to go to bVI6, since going to i would involve too little movement.  Another possibility would have been iv64 or iv43, but these chords usually need a bit more care.  bIII+64 to bVI6 is not the strongest-sounding progression, but it's the best one available given the circumstances.</p>
<p class="text">For otherwise consonant triads as 6 4 chords, we actually treat them a bit like non-harmonic tones.  They tend to happen on unaccented beats (except the cadential 6 4), and they tend to be a confluence of passing tones or neighbor tones that happen at the same time.  There are a few basic types:</p>

<? createExample('six four functions 2'); ?>

<p class="text">The <em>pedal 6 4</em>, also known as a <em>neighbor 6 4</em> (in analogy to neighbor tones), is usually when the notes of the 6 4 chord are two neighbor tones at the same time (measures 1 and 4), but so long as the bass stays the same from first chord to 6 4 to third chord, it's a pedal 6 4 (measures 1, 2, 4, 5, 7).  This chord is common as IV64 or iv64, a neighbor to I or i (measures 1, 2, 4, 5), but it could also happen on other scale degrees (measure 7).</p>
<p class="text">The <em>passing 6 4</em> is the more general kind of 6 4 chord, and this chord happens when the bass has a passing tone, usually between the 5 3 and 6 3 inversions of the same triad (measure 10), but it could happen between other inversions (measure 16), between similar chords (measure 11), or different chords altogether (measure 14).  You could even have multiple passing 6 4's in a row (measures 15 and 16), just like you can with passing tones; you'll just want to watch out for parallels, meaning that the one of the doubled notes needs to go in a different direction from all the other notes.  (Of course, if you're not in a four-voice texture, it doesn't really matter!)</p>
<p class="text">The <em>arpeggiating 6 4</em> is the chordal leap of the 6 4's; it happens when the bass moves between chord tones, therefore moving between inversions of the triad.  This 6 4 is not treated as a dissonance, but it's also not a <em>consonance</em>.  Rather, we tend to hear the other notes in the bass as the actual bass of the harmony, and the fact that the 5 is currently in the bass is just a little twist of melody.  In measures 18 and 19, we see a chord go from i to i64 to i6 to i, but really, it's just i the entire time; there's no real reason to hear them as separate chords.</p>
<p class="text">I should mention that some authors analyze these chords as entirely non-harmonic.  For example, the pedal 6 4 (sometimes Ped64) would actually be written in measure 1 as 5 3 to 6 4 to 5 3, all connected with horizontal lines, because the 6 4 isn't its own chord, just a combination of neighbor tones.  The passing 6 4 (sometimes P64) would just be written as P64, without any further information.  I think this obscures the harmony and what's really going on.  Just because some people don't think that 6 4 chords are real harmony doesn't mean <em>we</em> have to ignore them, right?  The arpeggiating 6 4 (Arp64) doesn't even get written.  No point, right?</p>
<p class="text">The <em>cadential 6 4</em> (Cad64) is the most common 6 4, at least in the Classical period.  This one is actually a double appoggiatura (or double suspension, or whatever), a 6-5 suspension and a 4-3 suspension on the same chord.  It generally occurs at the cadence; when you have a V - I, the V starts out with the suspended 6 and 4 (measure 21), which resolve before the chord resolves to I.  Some authors will write V64 - 53 (or V864 - 753 when the resolution is actually a V7).  Again, I prefer I64 - V7.  The ending in measure 21 is very typical of Common Practice cadences, with the octave leap in the bass, the resolution of the 64, and the 7th passing tone in an inner voice.  Except, of course, that it generally resolves to I, not what I did (measure 22), which was another cadential 6 4, this time on the tonic instead of the dominant.  (A cadence that makes you think it will resolve to I but resolves someplace else instead is called an <em>evaded cadence</em>.)  The cadential 6 4 can also be used at a half cadence (measure 24) on the V.  Technically speaking, the cadential 6 4 can be used anywhere, not necessarily just the cadence, but that's its most common use.</p>

<h3 class="subsection-title" id="seventh-chords">9.4.5 Seventh Chords</h3>

<p class="text">The triad is the largest collection of consonant pitch classes you can put together, so if you add any new note to it, it will no longer be consonant.  Over time, people realized that inserting a note between the 1 and 3 of the chord makes the dissonance difficult to resolve, and same for between the 3 and 5 or between the 4 and 6 or between the 6 and 8.  The only places where we can add a new note are between the 5 and 8 in a 5 3 chord, making either a 7 5 3 or a 6 5 3, between the 3 and 6 in a 6 3 chord, making a 6 5 3 or a 6 4 3, and between the 1 and 4 in a 6 4 chord, making a 6 4 3 or a 6 4 2.  These add up to four different chords: 7 5 3, 6 5 3, 6 4 3, and 6 4 2:</p>

<? createExample('seventh inversions'); ?>

<p class="text">These four kinds of chords come with shorthand: the 7 5 3 is written simply as 7, the 6 5 3 is written simply as 6 5, the 6 4 3 is written simply as 4 3, and the 6 4 2 is written simply as either 4 2 or just 2.  I learned music theory with 4 2, so that's what I'm going to use, but some books just use 2 to mean the same chord.</p>
<p class="text">In each of these chords, there's just one dissonance, assuming everything else works out.  In the 7 5 3, the 1 and 7 make a dissonant seventh, but the 3 and 7 make a fifth and the 5 and 7 make a third, both consonant (so long as it's a perfect fifth, anyway).  In the 6 5 3, the only dissonance is the second between the 5 and the 6.  In the 6 4 3, it's the second between the 4 and 3; in the 6 4 2, it's the second between the 1 and the 2.  These dissonances, being, well, dissonances, tend to want to resolve by step; any other resolution is unsatisfying.  The same is true for the most of the non-harmonic tones, except this dissonance <em>is</em> harmonic.  Of course, if one (or even both) of the fifths or fourths is diminished or augmented, you could have a further dissonance.</p>
<p class="text">Just like with the three-note consonant chords, the triads, each of these four chords (7, 6 5, 4 3, and 4 2) can have its notes rearranged into a stack of thirds, which is the 7 5 3 form; thus they are called <em>seventh chords</em>.  The bottom note of that 7 5 3 is the <em>root</em> of the chord, and the specific qualities of the 3, 5, and 7 intervals with the 1 determine the flavor of seventh chord.  You may remember these flavors from <? sectionLinkShort('pop chords sevenths'); ?> and <? sectionLinkShort('chords'); ?> in general.  Here's the full set of diatonic seventh chords in each of the three modes we've been looking at:</p>

<? createExample('diatonic sevenths'); ?>

<h4 class="question">My God.  I have to know <em>all</em> of these?</h4>
<p class="text">Well...  The vast majority don't come up.  The V7 does, absolutely, in all its inversions.  In fact, all of the inversions of these seventh chords are used; second inversion is perhaps less common, but it's a lot less radioactive than the 6 4 chord.  The ii7 (and iiø7) come up quite a lot.  The viiø7 not extremely often; the viio7 very often.  In phrygian dominant, the vø7 is very important.  Other than that, when it comes to the style of writing of Common Practice music, seventh chords come up but not all the time.  This is in pretty stark contrast to jazz-influenced genres, where <em>every</em> chord has a seventh.  The V7 and viio7, and to a lesser extent the ii7 and iiø7, are the "main" seventh chords you'll see.  Everything else is probably only there (in Common Practice music) as a result of melodic voice leading.</p>
<p class="text">Oh, and the weirder seventh chords using the altered tones from melodic minor?  Yeah, those don't come up unless you're doing something really far out there.  Which you could totally do.</p>
<p class="text">Let's start with the V7 and its inversions, because this is by far the most common use of 7th chords:</p>

<? createExample('seventh functions 1'); ?>

<p class="text">The regular resolution of a V7 is into I (measures 1, 2, <? exampleLink('functions 3'); ?> measure 25, <? exampleLink('six four functions 2'); ?> measures 8, 21) or i (measures 3, 12, <? exampleLink('functions 3'); ?> measure 26, <? exampleLink('sixth functions 2'); ?> measures 14, 16).  In Common Practice music, the vast majority of the time when there's any sort of final-sounding cadence, this is what happens, V7 - I or V7 - i (actually, V7 - I happens even in minor, but we'll get to that).  Now, in four-part writing, this produces some problematic voice leading, because the V7 contains the 7, the leading tone, which is active and wants to resolve up to 1, as well as the 4, which is dissonant, so it wants to resolve down to 3 or b3.  The progression is in root position (we're assuming), so we already have 5 going to 1 in the bass.  So if 5 goes to 1, 4 goes to 3, and 7 goes to 1, where does the 2 go, and what note in the V7 chord leads to the 5 in the I chord?  If the 2 goes to the 5, that's parallel fifths.  There are three common solutions.  The first, in measure 1, is to omit the fifth in the I chord.  Then the 2 goes to the 1 and all is well.  The second, in measure 2, is to omit the fifth in the V chord, doubling the root.  Then the second 5 in the V7 chord goes to the 5 in the I, making a complete I chord but an incomplete V7.  The third, in measures 3 and 12, is to have the 7 go down to the 5 instead of to the 1.  It's less satisfying, but it's the compromise composers tend to take.  If the 7 is in the soprano (measures 1 and 2), it (usually) sounds a lot worse to have it go down to the 5, but if the 2 is in the soprano, it's less awkward.</p>
<h4 class="question">Why does it sound bad?  When doesn't it sound bad?</h4>
<p class="text">We're pretty far into the book, but we only just now started talking about functional harmony in detail; you know why that is?  Because melody is what's really important, not harmony.  Harmony exists to add another dimension to the music, but the original dimension is melody.  Melodically, the leading tone leads to the tonic, which is why it sounds bad if it doesn't — remember that a chord progression is just a bunch of melodies at the same time.  <em>But</em>, if you've previously established melodic motifs that guide the melody, a motif going from 7 to 5 is entirely appropriate.</p>
<p class="text">The 7th of the V7 can also be thought of as a passing tone; this is a fairly common embellishment after a cadential 64 (measure 12).</p>
<p class="text">The V65 chord is just the first inversion variant of V7, and it's used... whenever (measures 5, 7, <? exampleLink('six four functions 2'); ?> measure 12).  Root position is stronger, so using a V65 instead of a V7 leads to a weaker progression, which is good when you're in the middle of a piece and you don't want your cadence to sound too final because there's more piece after.</p>
<p class="text">The V43 chord is not as common, but it does feature one of the few exceptions to the <del>rule</del> <em>custom</em> about sevenths resolving down: <em>if</em> you have 1 2 3 (or 1 2 b3) in the bass <em>and</em> 3 4 5 (or b3 4 5) in the soprano, then it's OK to use a V43 chord instead of just a viio6 (measure 8).  Otherwise, V43 is just the V chord you get when the 2 is in the bass, which is fairly weak since it sounds like a second inversion so it doesn't happen all that often.  It can resolve to the I (or i) or the I6 (or i6), depending on the direction of the progression (<? exampleLink('six four functions 2'); ?> measure 17).</p>
<p class="text">The V42 chord is quite common.  Some authors actually just call it a V2 chord, so don't worry if you see that somewhere.  The dissonant 7th is in the bass, making for an active bass line, and it pretty much has to resolve to the I6 (or i6), since that dissonance resolves down (measures 10, 16, <? exampleLink('sixth functions 3'); ?> measure 7).  The 42 chord in general has a somewhat polychordal feel, since the upper notes form a triad that the bass doesn't participate in, so it's a different sound from most of the rest of the music in Common Practice, and, again, it calls attention to the bass, which is nice if that's what you're going for.  In my personal opinion, the third inversion is the most distinctive inversion of the 7th chord.</p>
<p class="text">The V7 chord can also resolve irregularly, and sometimes this can fake out the listener who's expecting a V7 - I but gets a V7 - vi (measure 14) or V7 - bVI (measure 15) instead.  This is called a <em>deceptive cadence</em>, or sometimes an <em>evaded cadence</em> or an <em>interrupted cadence</em>.  These words are sometimes more specific and sometimes less specific; I use "deceptive cadence" to refer to V - vi (or V - bVI) and "interrupted cadence" in the general sense.  The "evaded cadence" is in measure 16, where the expected V - I becomes V - I6 by means of a passing tone in the bass.  THe root position V chord is strong, but with the bass going down to the 7th and giving up its root position, the cadence is weak instead.  Finally, in measure 17 we have V7 - IV, but that's not <em>really</em> that different because that IV is just a detour on the way to I.  Note that in this resolution, the 7th <em>doesn't</em> resolve down, but instead the 5's resolve in both directions.  It also involves what is sometimes called a <em>cross-relation of the tritone</em>, which is where two notes in different voices form a tritone in adjacent moments, in this case the B in the first chord with the bass F in the second.  The particular motion of the 7 going up to 1 at the same time as the 5 goes down to 4 is avoided in Common Practice because it sounds a little awkward, but you could always say that it's stylistically awkward and use it anyway.</p>
<p class="text">Let's take a moment here to talk about what just happened.</p>
<h4 class="question">Wait, did I miss something?  What just happened?</h4>
<p class="text">We're taking a moment here to talk about it!  Let me have my moment!</p>
<p class="text">We have two tendency tones in the V7 chord, the 7, which is the leading tone, and the 4, which is the dissonant seventh.  These two tendency tones are also dissonant with each other, forming a tritone that usually has to be resolved, but the tritone is secondary to the more important dissonance of the seventh between the 5, the root, and the 4.  So we <em>generally</em> want the 7 to go up to 1 and the 4 to go down to 3.  In measures 14 and 15, this happens; it's just that the resulting chord isn't the I (or i) chord.  On the other hand, this does <em>not</em> happen in measure 17.  We've never really figured out a good definition of <em>functional</em> harmony, but at the least we need to have chord roots progressing in a sensible way and voice leading working in a sensible way.  I'd argue that the progression V7 - IV is <em>not</em> functional, but treating the IV as an appoggiatura or passing chord to the I makes it OK.  On the other hand, the voice leading is far too irregular.  I guess you justify everything as non-harmonic tones coming together to make something harmonic.  In the soprano, you have B - C - C — the first C is an anticipation, obviously.  In the alto, G - A - G — the A is a neighbor tone.  In the tenor, F - F - E — this is fine.  In the bass... well, how about this, the bass <em>should</em> go G - F - E, making the F a passing tone, but it ends with C instead, which is OK because you already have F resolving to E in the tenor.  So, you see, the IV is an incidental chord that happens through voice leading, not really a functional harmonic chord.  In fact, it would sound weird and incomplete if you played V7 - IV without going to I afterwards.</p>
<h4 class="question">So if it's a chord made of voice leading, it's not functional?  Wait, I don't get it, what's a chord made of voice leading?  Aren't all chords made of voice leading?</h4>
<p class="text">Ergh, you're poking holes in my argument.</p>
<h4 class="question">Sorry!</h4>
<p class="text">The reason we're learning how these chords are used — as opposed to simply looking at the root and knowing how to label it — is because each chord behaves in a particular way in functional harmony.  That's a little circular, but that's OK.  If you use the chord in other ways, it's no longer functional.  This is not by any means a bad thing, of course, and it can make pieces much more interesting.  Functional harmony exists within a tonal system, where the notes of the scale have their own tendencies, especially relative to the chords.  Sometimes, the notes can follow their tendencies but end up on a chord that otherwise doesn't fit the logic of the functional system.  The passing 64 chords we've seen in <? exampleLink('six four functions 2'); ?> are examples of this.  This V7 - IV thing is another example.  V7 <em>doesn't go</em> to IV, but the voices are still behaving relatively well and the tonal system isn't broken.  Another example happens in Albéniz's Tango in D, <? exampleLink('Albeniz Tango'); ?>, measure 15, which I kind of misleadingly labeled as viio6/vii (we'll get into why that's not valid).  That chord is made up of three chromatic neighbor tones, and it does not actually have a function.</p>
<p class="text">On the other hand, some of these voice leading chords are so common that we've kind of adopted them into the functional system, namely the augmented 6th chords.  We'll talk about them soon.</p>
<p class="text">Right now I want to take a slight detour and talk about the V9 and V7b9 chords.  You can't get a complete V9 in a four-voice texture to sound all at once, but who says you need to stick to four voices, and who says all of the notes need to sound at once?  Still, though:</p>

<? createExample('ninth inversions'); ?>

<h4 class="question">What.  In the fuck.</h4>
<p class="text">Yeah.  So ninth chords rarely come up in Common Practice, and when they do, they're not usually inverted, and when they are, they pretty much are never in fourth inversion, because the ninth doesn't have the same effect when it's below the root.  The upshot is that you <em>don't</em> need to know these inversion numbers.  I found them in Walter Piston's book on harmony (which leaves out the fourth inversion entirely), and I'd never seen them anywhere else before.  This is, unfortunately, one of those times when Roman numeral notation is inadequate, but we can really just worry about this problem when we get there.  I tend to ignore ninths anyway and just pretend that they're 7th chords unless the 9th is particularly important.</p>
<p class="text">That's not why I want to talk about them, though.  These are all <em>dominant</em> chords in C major or minor.  V7's and V9's.  And what happens if you omit the root of a V7?  You get a viio.  And if you omit the root of a V9 or V7b9?  You get a viiø7 or a viio7.  In fact, some authors will confusingly call a viio chord a Vo7 and they'll call a viio7 a Vo9, with the circle representing a missing root.</p>
<h4 class="question">So viio and Vo are basically the same chord?</h4>
<p class="text">No, because those same authors won't use o for diminished chords like I do.  In fact, in my college theory class, we didn't use the o symbol at all.  We used all uppercase numerals, so what I might call i - viio6 - i6 would have just been I - VII6 - I6, and you'd just be able to tell that these were minor/diminished chords from context.  In a situation like this, using Vo9 was unambiguous, and we learned that as an alternative name for the chords we called VII7.  If you label chords the other way, with the lowercase numerals and the o sign for diminished chords, you really shouldn't talk about a Vo chord.  Maybe V0, but that will get confusing.  So I'm going to stick with the viio's, thank you very much.</p>
<p class="text">Anyway, what this means is that we can treat viio (and viiø) chords much like we treat V7 chords — they're all dominant.  Let's see how all these guys behave, starting with the ninths and the viiø7:</p>

<? createExample('seventh functions 2'); ?>

<h4 class="question">Why did we skip the viio7?</h4>
<p class="text">We'll get to it next; it's an important chord but it behaves differently from the V9 and viiø7.  In the V9 chord (including the V7b9), there are two dissonant notes: the 7th, which resolves down, and the ninth, which also resolves down.  In the viiø7 chord, the 7th is the same note as the 9th in the V9 and it also has to resolve down, though the 5th, which is the same note as the 7th in the V7 and V9, is free to resolve in any direction (even though it sounds nicer when it resolves down).  On the other hand, the viio7 chord is symmetric, so these restrictions don't apply the same way.</p>
<p class="text">We'll begin with the V9 (or V7b9).  It resolves to I (or i) (measures 1, 2, 10, 12).  Note that, in four-part writing, the fifth is the note that goes, because the other notes are too definitional for the sound of the chord.  Take away the third and the mode is lost; take away the seventh and the complexity is lost; take away the ninth and it's a V7, not a ninth chord; take away the root and it's a viiø7, not a V9.  So the fifth has to go.  We see this in first inversion (measures 3 and 4) and third inversion (measures 7 and 8).  Fourth inversion just doesn't make sense as a chord, but I'm sure you can figure out ways to use it if you want!  In general, these chords behave just like V7 chords except that there's an added note that needs to resolve.</p>
<p class="text">Second inversion is a bit more special, because that's what happens when you not only <em>don't</em> skip the fifth, you put it in the bass.  There, the best compromise is to skip the seventh, but, again, you could always just not use four-part writing, right?  The problem is that you get parallel fifths between the bass and the ninth if you try to resolve the bass down, so in major, you have to go up (measure 5).  If you're in minor, the bass forms a tritone with the ninth, not a perfect fifth, so you can resolve them both down (measure 6).  That said, dominant ninths in second inversion don't come up all that often.</p>
<p class="text">In measures 9 and 10 and in measures 11 and 12 we have little phrases showing a V9 in context: the ninth here is <em>prepared</em> by being a consonant note in the previous chord.  Dissonances are often prepared this way (or in other ways), though that's not at all a requirement.  It does make the ninth feel like a suspension, though, which makes sense since it's a dissonance.  The line between non-harmonic tone and harmonic dissonance is quite blurry.</p>
<h4 class="question">Why did you use different chords in measures 9 and 11?  Why not just use iio6 in 11 to make it similar to 9?</h4>
<p class="text">Well, I did that, and it sounded bad, so I changed it.  There are a couple of reasons for that.  The first is that the first chord in 9 and 11 is dissonant; it's a tonic seventh (which we haven't talked about yet, but we will shortly).  In 9, it resolves to a consonance, the ii6, but in 11, if it resolved to iio6, it would be a dissonance.  The standard resolution of a seventh chord is to the chord with root up a fourth, so I65 - ii6 is a little irregular, but it's fine because ii6 is consonant and is only one note away from IV.  The problem is in measure 11, where not only is i65 - iio6 irregular, but the chord of resolution is dissonant while the regular resolution is consonant.  So I changed it to iv.  I think it sounds better that way.</p>
<p class="text">The viiø7 works pretty much exactly like the V9 in major, except that the fifth doesn't sound so terrible if it doesn't resolve down.  We have it in root position (measure 13), first inversion (measure 16), and second inversion (measure 17), where the bass would normally require going to I6 but here it goes to I in root position instead, and the listener is not disappointed.  I mentioned that the regular resolution for a seventh chord is up a fourth, which we have here in measure 14.  This brings up an interesting point about the viiø7 and the viio chords in general, which is that, while they <em>generally</em> act as rootless V7's and V9's, sometimes they actually act like chords built on the 7th degree.  For people who write Vo to represent a rootless dominant, viiø7 - iii would actually be written VII7 - III instead of Vo9 - III.  Given how infrequently iii comes up anyway, it's fairly uncommon to see a true subtonic viio or viiø chord that isn't a rootless V.  The situation is simpler in minor, because viio is always a rootless dominant there (the true chord on the seventh degree is bVII) unless you're doing something really weird with the mode.</p>
<p class="text">In the viiø7 chord you don't need to skip any notes (if you did, the note to skip here is actually the third, not the fifth, since the fifth gives the chord its diminished quality), but you still get the issue of parallel fifths if the third resolves down, because, remember, the seventh has to resolve down.  If you put the third in the soprano, they're now in fourths instead of fifths, so they can both go down (measure 15).  Usually, though, the seventh is too cool to not put in the soprano (or the melody has that note but the composer wants to harmonize it with a kind of V chord).</p>
<p class="text">I must admit that I haven't seen this note in the bass... ever, as far as I can remember.  I've checked a few theory books and viiø42 has just not come up.  I'm not entirely surprised, because the chord <em>doesn't sound great</em>.  Obviously that's a judgment call and you're free to disagree, but try to find a voicing that works.  The issue is that the root is the note that sounds dissonant here, not the seventh in the bass.  You have an unstable second inversion ii chord with a 7 added.  The half-diminished seventh chord is less goal-oriented than the dominant seventh as a sonority, and in this position it's even less goal-oriented, causing it to sound just kind of bad.  There's good dissonance, which begs for resolution (whether it receives it or not), and bad dissonance, which doesn't, and this inversion is the latter.  There's the added issue that the bass has to resolve down to the 5 and the chord's resolution is the I chord, so it resolves to I64.  Maybe you can come up with a better use for this chord, but the one in measure 18 is fairly disappointing.</p>
<p class="text">Part of what makes the viiø7 awkward is that it shares three notes with each of V7 and ii due to being a third away from each of them, but as the ii and V have strong rooted feelings, the two chords don't sound similar.  The situation is different in minor, since iio is diminished; it sounds just like a subset of viio7, which itself is a subset of V7b9.  Let's see how the viio7 handles things:</p>

<? createExample('seventh functions 3'); ?>

<p class="text">The viio7 behaves basically like a V65 and generally resolves to i (measures 2, 3); the viio65 behaves basically like a V43, linking i and i6 or similar (measures 4, 6), and the viio43 behaves basically like a V42, resolving to i6 (measure 12).  The main difference is the freer treatment of the notes in the chord, which are <em>all</em> equally dissonant, so the chord doesn't have any particular tendency to resolve anywhere.  It wants to resolve because it's dissonant, but it's symmetric, so where it resolves is up for grabs.  In a tonal context, though, following the tendencies of the notes in the chord, it wants to resolve to i (or I, but we'll talk about that later).  The b6 wants to resolve down to 5, because that's what the b6 does; the 4 wants to resolve down to b3; the 7 wants to resolve up to 1; the 2 can go anywhere, really.  This chord contains no perfect fifths, though, so we don't have to worry about parallels.</p>
<p class="text">The viio42 is less used because the resolution would be i64, not a common chord for resolving stuff.  When it comes up, it's usually a neighbor chord to V7 (measure 13), so you can think of the b6 as an embellishment tone in the bass.</p>
<p class="text">Due to the viio7 being symmetrical (in 12-tone equal temperament, anyway), there are only four such chords, which means that the same notes that form a viio7 in the key of C will also form one in the keys of Eb, F#, and A, up to enharmonics.  This can make the viio7 useful in modulation (measure 10).  Also, we haven't talked about secondary dominants yet in this section, but since V/iv is basically just a major version of the i, viio7 can resolve there too (measure 8).  In such a case, we often see the 7 going down to b7.  This is useful in chromatic lines too.</p>
<p class="text">I just want to call attention to the voice leading in these examples.  The leading tone goes up in all of them (except measure 8), because that's arguably the most important note in the chord.  The b6 also goes down in all of them.  Neither is some hard-and-fast requirement of the diminished 7th, but in minor, the 7 is used in upward passages and the b6 is used in downward ones, so by default, that's where these notes go.  Measure 8 has a bit of an exception; we haven't gotten into chromatic chord progressions yet, but the other place for the 7 to go is down to the b7.  The 2 and 4, on the other hand, aren't as active.  We see the 2 going down to 1 in measures 2, 6, and 10 (where the 2 is the F, since we're resolving in Eb major), and it goes up to b3 (or 3) in measures 3, 4, 8, and 12.  Where it goes just depends on how you want to voice the chord of the resolution.  The 4 resolves down to b3 in measures 2, 6, 10 (the Ab), and 12, while it goes up to 5 in measure 3 and leaps to 1 in measures 4 and 8.  As much as we usually like to resolve dissonances by step, the 4 is not nearly the most active note in the chord, so it doesn't sound weird when it doesn't resolve down like in a V7 or V7b9.  This is especially true in minor, where the distance between 4 and b3 is wider.</p>
<h4 class="question">What about the scary sound of the diminished 7th chord?  Isn't it supposed to be scary somehow?</h4>
<p class="text">What a question.  How do I even answer that...  We haven't generally been talking about emotional characteristics in the chords we're looking at, and it's because they're just not relevant to the chords' tonal function.  I'm glad you didn't forget about it entirely, because we tend to lose sight of the fact that, despite all these technical aspects of harmonic behavior, the thing we're really trying to study is beautiful; it's artistic; it's <em>music</em>.  The diminished 7th chord does have a harsh sound, and this harsh sound has traditionally been used <em>non</em>-functionally to evoke scary or tense situations — the favorite image is of some masked and mustachioed villain tying an innocent damsel to a pair of railroad tracks.  Scary chords!  Will the hero arrive on time?  Hopefully; he's coming on the next train.  Wait, the next train?  Oh no!  Scary chords!  Rising diminished 7ths!</p>
<h4 class="question">Huh, I didn't get any of that from <? exampleLink('seventh functions 3'); ?>.</h4>
<p class="text">That's the thing.  As a functional chord, the viio7 works... as expected.  Normally.  It's ambiguous and dissonant, but it's not <em>scary</em> or anything like that.  It's only when you use it deliberately as a sound effect that it can become scary.</p>
<p class="text">Let's move on to the rest of the world of 7th chords that we've been ignoring, the non-dominant sevenths (and ninths).  Most of them work about the same way, but the supertonic seventh is a bit special, so we'll start there:</p>

<? createExample('seventh functions 4'); ?>

<p class="text">The ii7 (and iiø7) is a 7th chord, and therefore its 7th — the 1 of the scale — wants to resolve down to 7, and the chord itself generally wants to resolve up a fourth to V or V7 (measures 1, 3, 9, 11, 15, 17, <? exampleLink('sixth functions 3'); ?> measure 7, <? exampleLink('seventh functions 1'); ?> measures 4, 6, <? exampleLink('seventh functions 3'); ?> measure 1).  Of course, it can go to viio or viio7 or even v instead, depending on circumstances.  The cool thing is that the ii7 is essentially a combination of the ii and IV chords.  It's definitely a pre-dominant, though.  People often end phrases on the IV, but you wouldn't want to end a phrase on a ii7, because that chord still has places to go!</p>
<p class="text">The ii65 (and iiø65) are very common chords.  In pop music, you would call them IV chords with an added 6th (in C, the chord would be F6 rather than Dm7/F).  It sounds like they're the same, but they're not quite the same: in the chord with the 6th, the 6th is the dissonance, while in a 7th chord, the 7th is the dissonance.  In a Dm7/F, the dissonant note is the C and it wants to resolve down; in an F6, it's the D and it wants to resolve up.  That said, we don't really make a distinction in the Roman numerals.  We just call it a ii65.  In measures 5 and 7 it goes to viiø43 and viio43, respectively, but it could well have gone to V42 or V in root position.  The one thing that would be weird is if it went to V65 or to any chord with a 7 in the bass.</p>
<h4 class="question">Oh, because of the melodic tritone?</h4>
<p class="text">No, actually; a leap of a tritone is OK so long as that voice then moves by step in the other direction to resolve the melodic dissonance.  THe reason it's problematic is because the 1 in the ii7 (any inversion) resolves to the 7, so if the bass <em>also</em> goes to the 7, you're doubling the leading tone, and that doesn't usually sound very good.  That's why in measure 9, the ii43 goes down to V7 instead of up to V65.  In measure 11 it wouldn't have made sense anyway because the b6 goes down in minor, not up.  If you do want a 6 going to 7 in a ii-type chord, your best bet is to use IV6 (measure 13).  That frees the 1 to go up instead of down, since it's no longer a dissonance.</p>
<p class="text">The other, obvious way to get a 7 in the bass is to use a ii42 or iiø42 (measures 15, 17).  The 1 is in the bass, so when it resolves down, it goes to 7.  This particular progression, I - ii42 - V65 - I (or its minor equivalent i - iiø42 - V65 - i), is quite common in introductions to pieces (see <? exampleLink('WTC Prelude 1'); ?>).</p>
<p class="text">Keeping with the theme of pre-dominant 7th chords, the IV7 chord (in major) is somewhat special in that it doesn't resolve up a fourth, since that fourth would be a tritone and the resolution chord would be diminished anyway.  It can still do so in sequences, but it generally doesn't; instead, it's used to harmonize the 3 in a 3 - 2 - 1 melody (another possibility, discussed above in <? sectionLinkShort('analysis roman six four'); ?>, is a I64 chord).  The 3 is a dissonant seventh and therefore resolves down.  This is in measure 19.  Because I could, I had the 6 go up as well, but you could easily have switched the tenor and soprano on that chord, such that it would be voiced F C E A instead, and the C would go down to B and the A down to G.  I didn't do that because we get so little opportunity to have the 6 go up to 7 as it is.  If I had, then measure 21 would have been iv7 - V - I, a respectable progression, but instead, we have the raised 6th, making a IVb7 (or IVdom7) instead.  I think it sounds a bit weird, but it's kosher in minor!  These two chords are here in order to introduce the ii9 in measure 23, which behaves the same way: the dissonant 9th resolves down, as does the 7th.  Non-dominant 9ths are quite rare in Common Practice music, but there's no reason not to use this perfectly functional chord.  On the other hand, it's usually too dissonant in minor, because the ninth is minor and it doesn't play well with the other notes.  It would be far better to use a secondary dominant ninth in that situation — more about that later.</p>
<p class="text">Let's continue with the other non-dominant 7ths.  In general, the seventh in a chord acts more like an appoggiatura or suspension than anything else.  This means that, for the other diatonic triads, you can pretty much add a seventh whenever this sort of appoggiatura would make sense.  It often sounds better with preparation — that is, having the note sound as a consonant member of the previous chord in the same voice — but that's not really necessary.  So here are the chords:</p>

<? createExample('seventh functions 5'); ?>

<p class="text">Remember the circle of fifth sequence from <? exampleLink('functions 3'); ?>?  We can do that with 7th chords instead.  With the chords all in root position, we run into the same issue we had with the V7 - I: the 7th of the first chord goes down to the third of the next; the third of the first becomes the 7th on the next; the root of the first goes to the root of the next (because these chords are in root position); what happens to the fifth?  We have to skip the fifth in one of the chords in order to resolve everything nicely.  This is what happens in measures 1-4 and 9-12.  In general, you can always omit the fifth of a seventh chord, but for non-dominant 7ths the third is often also a viable note to skip.  An alternative is to simply use the chords in inversion, either something like I7 - IV43 or I65 - IV42.  I went with the latter in measures 5-8 and 13-16, and you can see that these are all complete chords.  We haven't really talked about it yet, but I went ahead and used some chromaticism in 13-16 to get some of the less-used 7th chords in there.</p>
<p class="text">The I7 or i7 generally goes to IV or iv (measures 1, 5, 9, 13), but it could also go to ii (measures 19, 20), since that chord is so similar to IV.  In measure 20, the seventh resolves up, contrary to the usual way these things go, and it's a weaker resolution.  Why did I do that?  Because 7 - 6 would have made parallel fifths with the 3 - 2 in the bass.  There's another situation that happens specifically with the I chord (though it could happen with other chords if you wanted it to), which is when the 7th is actually a retardation into the root (measures 17, 18, 26).  It's up to you whether you want to call that 7th harmonic or not.  Measure 18 in particular has this effect in minor, which is one of the few situations in Common Practice harmony when you might get an mM7 chord.  While the regular resolution of a 7th chord is up a fourth, we see with the I7 that it can also go up a second, and the same is true for all the other 7th chords even if I don't explicitly show you examples.</p>
<p class="text">We've already talked about the iiø7 chord, but there's a situation in which it <em>doesn't</em> really function as a pre-dominant and goes to i (or I, but we're staying diatonic for now) (measure 35).  The third is often skipped in this chord, and when voiced in three parts, it's actually a iiø43 rather than a iiø42, with the b6 in the bass.</p>
<p class="text">The iii7 or bIII7 goes to vi or bVI (measures 2, 6, 10, 14, 21, 23).  Again, it could go to IV or iv instead if you wanted it to (measure 32); it's just a less regular resolution.  21 and 23 are different in that 21 uses the b7 and 23 uses the 7.  The b7 goes down in 21, while the 7 goes up in 23.  The chord in 23 is an ugly but functional one, a M7#5 chord (in first inversion); it doesn't come up a whole lot.</p>
<p class="text">The iv7 can go to bVII (measures 9, 13), but the IV7 <em>doesn't</em> generally go to viio (measures 1, 5) because that's up a tritone rather than a perfect fourth.  An exception is made when the melody is very strong or there's a sequence; the latter is the case here.  While iv7 <em>can</em> go to bVII, it usually doesn't; the usual way the IV7 and iv7 go is to V (<? exampleLink('seventh functions 4'); ?> measures 19, 21), which you'll recall is pretty similar to the viio anyway.  Treating the 7th as non-harmonic, we can also resolve the IV7 to ii6 or ii65 (measure 25).</p>
<p class="text">The vi7 goes to ii (measures 3, 7), but the bVI7 <em>doesn't</em> generally go to iio (measure 11) because that's a tritone rather than a fourth (again, an exception is made for a strong melody or a sequence).  Both chords can serve as pre-dominants, though, and they readily go to V (measures 27, 37).  The viø65 in 15 is chromatic and I don't want to talk about it just yet, but the viø7 in 29 is more usual.  It basically has to go to V6 like in 27 because the raised sixth, which is in the bass, goes to the raised seventh.  In this case I opted for a bit of embellishment and made it a viio7 instead.  That would have introduced a cross-relation, with the A natural in the bass followed by the Ab in the tenor, so I added a passing tone to make the cross-relation less awkward.</p>
<p class="text">Finally, the bVII7 would normally go to bIII (measure 10), but mostly, if you see a bVII7, you're really seeing a V7 in the key of the bIII.  (The bVII7 can resolve up to i, in what we call the <em>backdoor cadence</em>, but more on that later.)  It's a bit stuck, this one, because the b7 goes down in minor, and the 7th of the chord, the b6, <em>also</em> goes down, so you end up with fairly nasty-sounding parallel sevenths.  This isn't an insurmountable problem by any means, but this sort of progression just doesn't really happen much.  You can see it in measure 36, where the 7th <em>doesn't</em> resolve down.  This is one of those exceptions like we saw with the V43 in <? exampleLink('seventh functions 1'); ?>, because the scalar lines in the soprano and alto win out.  You don't want to double the 7th in the bVI7 chord, so the 7th in the bVII7 has to resolve someplace else.  The 7th in the bVI7 doesn't resolve down either for the same reason.  Note that there are four possibly diatonic chords on the 7th degree in minor: the bVII7, the bVII#7, the viio7, and the viiø7.  The bVII#7 and viiø7 both have a raised 6th degree as a 7th, so they're not really suitable.  You could try to find a use for them, I'm sure, but the bVII#7 is too dissonant anyway and the viiø7 just sounds like major.</p>
<p class="text">I think that's pretty much all of them for major and minor.</p>
<h4 class="question">What about the v7?  Doesn't that come up in minor?</h4>
<p class="text">Not really, at least not according to the minor mode.  I suppose it could go to i7 or bVI (measure 31), having the b7 either stay still or resolve down to the b6, and it could happen in a sequence like in measure 31 (if the sequences in 9-12 and 13-16 continued, the chord in measures 12 and 16 would have been a v7), but the prevailing practice is to raise the 7 when the harmony is a V chord.  We'll see this chord come up when we relax these rules of modality, along with the bVII7 in some interesting positions.</p>
<p class="text">Speaking about this sequence in 31-34, this is a Pachelbel sequence (just like we saw in <? exampleLink('functions 4'); ?> but shorter) where the chords go kind of in reverse — down a fourth rather than up a fourth, followed by going up a second.  The second chord is a natural choice for a 7th chord, since it then goes up a step, which is the alternate resolution for 7th chords in general.  I added an anticipation to put 7th chords on the downbeats too.  That anticipation motion is why the 7th chords on the downbeats don't resolve like 7th chords — the dissonant tone is really part of the <em>next</em> chord.  In fact, I called them 7th chords here — and I labeled beat 3 of measure 33 as a bIII+6 — but I probably shouldn't have, since the dissonances are non-harmonic.  There's a balance to strike between calling something part of the chord and not.</p>
<p class="text">To finish out this section, let's see what things are like in phrygian dominant, where the b7 is not an active tone but the b2 is.</p>

<? createExample('seventh functions 6'); ?>

<h4 class="question">Did Bach write in phrygian dominant?</h4>
<p class="text">Not really, no.</p>
<h4 class="question">So why are we even talking about it here?</h4>
<p class="text">Why, don't you want to know how harmony in phrygian dominant works?</p>
<h4 class="question">I mean, yes, but...  why <em>here</em>?</h4>
<p class="text">Well, despite being ignored in most music theory texts — some theorists dispute that it even exists, analyzing the I of phrygian dominant as a V chord in a minor key a fourth up — it's definitely a real mode, and it has definitely been used in classical-type music, even in (the later parts of) the Common Practice Period.  It follows the logic of the old phrygian mode, where the final cadence was bvii - I, major third there at the end.  It's worth studying because it's a different system of harmony that <em>still works functionally</em>; we just need to reorient ourselves a bit because the true leading tone is the b2, not the 7.  In the days of modal polyphony, every other mode used the 7 as a leading tone at the final cadence, including mixolydian, dorian, and aeolian, where the seventh degree had to be altered, but not in phrygian.  So, if we can apply the same principles we've been using in this fundamentally different mode, that means we really understand them.  Let's look at the seventh chords, then.</p>
<p class="text">First, the vø7.  We said earlier that the v7 has no <em>dominant</em> use in Common Practice minor, due to the b7 needing to move down within the mode.  Phrygian dominant does not have this restriction; what we do have is a b2 that can go down to 1 or up to b3 (but not to 3; that's an augmented second).  So, the vø7 chord can resolve to I just fine: b2 goes to 1, b7 goes to 1 or 5, 4 goes to 3, 5 goes to 1 or 5 (measures 1, 4, 6, 12, 15, 20).  The 43 position is especially nice for this chord since the b2 in the bass is very powerful, and since the chord is diminished anyway, the 5 isn't a strong acoustic root anyway, so the chord doesn't have the off-balance feel that second-inversion chords often have.  Measure 7 is an interesting case that happens very frequently in Spanish music.  The tonic is held over the vø7 chord, acting as a pedal; here, it takes the place of the third of the chord.  The third of the vø7 chord is relatively unimportant; the b2 and 4 are definitely active (and are present in the other dominant equivalents, bvii and bII), but the third can be skipped.  Even the root is unimportant, but the 5 of the vø7 being kept in the I chord is a characteristic effect (measures 6, 7, 12), so we get the vø7 frequently instead of just the bvii or bII.  In fact, in three-part writing, you'll often have a chord consisting of the b2, 4, and 5, which is a vø43 with no third, resolving to 1 3 5, a I.</p>
<p class="text">The bII7, by virtue of having a 1, is relegated to pre-dominancy (measures 5, 19).  This also solves the problem of parallel fifths with the b2 and b6 resolving to 1 and 5, respectively, if you find that sort of thing to be a problem (honestly, I'm OK with them in this case).  The b6 goes to the 5 but the b2 stays.</p>
<p class="text">The bvii7 still works as a dominant (measures 10, 13), though the parallel fifths are pretty much unavoidable here because the 7th is the b6 and it goes down.  It can also go to bIII (measure 18).</p>
<p class="text">The Ib7 would regularly go to iv (measures 3, 17), but then it's really just a V7 in the key of the iv so it's not really worth giving it its own identity as a seventh chord.  It can also go to bII (measure 5), allowing choices when harmonizing a descending b7.</p>
<p class="text">The bIIIb7 pretty much goes to bII or bvii or vo (measure 9), since the b3 usually descends to b2 in phrygian dominant.  If it doesn't, it can also go to bVI (measure 19).  The iiio7, on the other hand, is happy to go to iv (measure 11), but note that you could also just analyze it as viio7 in the key of the iv.  (In fact, you could analyze most of these chords as just being in the key of the iv, but the direction is clearly towards the I.)  iiio7 could also go to some other chord with the iv in the bass, like a bII6; as a diminished 7th chord, it can really go anywhere, but the question is where it can go while maintaining the tonality.</p>
<p class="text">The iv7 goes to vø7 just like in minor (well, except that it's V7 in minor, not vø7 — details) (measure 3).  It can also go up a fourth to bvii (measure 17), but given that bvii is a dominant equivalent, it doesn't really make much of a difference.  The iv#7 chord is kind of stuck, since the 3 doesn't descend.  You may be able to use it like the i#7 in minor, where the 7th is an appoggiatura or retardation, but if the iv has that much weight, are you sure you haven't modulated?</p>
<p class="text">The bVI is the relative major and it doesn't have much of a place in phrygian dominant to begin with, but you can have a bVI7 or bVI7#5 go to a dominant (measures 13, 15).  The root going up a fourth usually sounds nice (measures 13, 19).  The b3 of the bVI7 generally goes down to b2 (measure 19), but it doesn't really have to (measure 13).  The 3 of the bVI7#5 does have to go up to avoid an augmented interval.</p>
<p class="text">In measures 17-20, there's a circle of fifths sequence in phrygian dominant, but this time, the chords alternate between the 7 and 43 positions.  A little bit of chromaticism was necessary in measure 17 to prevent an augmented second, but as long as we keep that b2, we don't lose that freygish feeling we love.</p>
<p class="text">OK, now that we've gone through all of the 7th chords, let's take a look at what we've learned.  Seventh chords are dissonant, and for major, minor, and dominant 7ths, the 7th itself is the dissonant note in the chord and its tendency is to resolve <em>down</em>.  Seventh chords can be on any scale degree and add to the melodic possibilities of these chords, but the 7th itself is mainly melodic, not harmonic, in most of these chords.  Most seventh chords resolve a fourth up, but sometimes they resolve a step up instead.  Sometimes the 7th is actually an appoggiatura or retardation of the root, and it resolves up to it as a non-harmonic tone.  That's the Common Practice 7th chord in a nutshell.</p>
<p class="text">The last thing to discuss here are ninth chords, eleventh chords, and thirteenth chords.  I'm actually <em>not</em> going to explore them in depth here, and that's because there's really nothing to explore in the context of Common Practice; these chords don't come up, except for the dominant ninths that we've already discussed and the ii9 on occasion.  But if they do, the 9th resolves down; the b9 especially so.  The 11th usually stays where it is, since extended chords typically resolve up a fourth; the 11th is the root of the next chord.  (In contrast, a suspended fourth resolves down, which is one of the ways you can tell if the fourth is suspended or an 11th.)  The #11 only comes up diatonically in IV chords, and its tendency will likely depend on how the chord is voiced.  The 13th resolves down too.  On the other hand, the #5 resolves up, but we haven't talked about chord alterations yet.  For the most part, any of these extended chords can probably be understood better as non-harmonic tones, so we won't talk about them anymore for now and we'll save them for when we move away from Common Practice voice leading, where these chord extensions exist as color tones and don't function melodically.</p>
<p class="text">Since we've exhausted the diatonic supply in C, let's move on to other notes and other keys!</p>

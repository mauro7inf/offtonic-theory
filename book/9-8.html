<p class="text">One of the most important functions of harmony is to provide closure to a musical idea, even if it's only partial closure to the first half of the musical idea to signal that the second half is still to come.  That closure is called a <em>cadence</em>.</p>
<h4 class="question">Cadence, like, your affect, etc. when you talk?</h4>
<p class="text">Sigh.  So, unfortunately, the word "cadence" has several meanings in music.  One example of a cadence is a drum cadence, which is a piece of music played by a drum section of a marching group while said group marches.  Here is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zyyAa_Z12M">my high school's drum cadence</a>.  Sorry for the quality, but it's the only video I could find.  This a field performance of the cadence, though; the "native" situation in which it would happen is that we'd be marching somewhere, and the drum line would play this or another cadence to keep time.  Another meaning of the word "cadence" is the one you mentioned: the cadence of your speech is its rhythm, its intonation, its phrase length, how long you wait in between words, etc.  Cadence in speech is often a first symptom into some possible neurological problems.  There's also the cadenza, a solo section of a piece of music played out of time (which used to be featured at final cadences, hence the name).  All of these come from the Latin "cadere", meaning to fall, but the cadence we're going to talk about in this section is the one that comes at the end of a phrase to tell us that the phrase has ended.  As a very simple example, consider Stephen Foster's song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSIj17xbAyk">Oh Susanna</a> (be aware that, um, racism; this song might be beloved Americana today, but in its original form it would not be so beloved, I hope):</p>

<? createExample('Oh Susanna melody'); ?>

<p class="text">The cadences are marked with fermatas at measures 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24.  A cadence marks where a phrase ends, so these are, naturally, four-bar phrases.  The melody actually <em>stops</em> at the cadences.  We'll find that this doesn't always happen, but if it doesn't have some sense of <em>ending</em> something, it's not a cadence, even if it otherwise looks like one.  This song is written here in G major, and, as you can see, the cadences at measures 8, 16, and 24 end on the G, the tonic, while the cadences at measures 4, 12, and 20 do not.  A cadence that ends on the I chord is called a full cadence, while the one that ends on the V is a half-cadence.  This makes a bit less sense when we're looking at a melody that isn't accompanied by a harmony, but, then again, the implied harmony is obvious here: the cadences at 4, 12, and 20 are half-cadences, while the cadences at 8, 16, and 24 are full cadences.</p>
<p class="text">Cadences turn out to be very interesting and it's very useful to study them in depth, so... that's what we're gonna do now!</p>

<? createTableOfContents($label) ?>

<h3 class="subsection-title" id="melodic">9.8.1 Melodic Cadences</h3>

<p class="text">The first form of the cadence we'll look at is purely melodic.  We're going to understand the <em>idea</em> of a cadence before learning the harmonic formulas.</p>
<h4 class="question">Oh, because cadences are really complicated?</h4>
<p class="text">No, actually.  They're really simple.  It's because people tend to get confused between a chord progression and an actual cadence.  Just as an example, the authentic cadence goes V - I, but just because some chords go V - I doesn't mean that they're a cadence at all.  If you listen to, say, Hoagy Carmichael's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8CSjDC18b0">Heart and Soul</a>, you'll hear lots of V - I's (the chord loop goes I - vi - (ii or IV) - V - I - vi - (ii or IV) - V - I - ...), but not all of them are actually cadences!</p>
<h4 class="question">Wait, wait, Heart and Soul has lyrics?  I thought it was just a little song people played together on the piano!</h4>
<p class="text">It's an actual jazz standard.  Even has a bridge!  It's one of those funny occasions where the caricature of the song became widely known but the original, not so much.  It's a fine song, though.  Jazz with clarinets!</p>
<p class="text">In any case, melodic cadences.  A <em>cadence</em> is a point where the music unambiguously arrives and finishes a statement of some sort.  Throughout the centuries, many ways of doing this have become standard, as well as many ways of <em>not</em> doing this.  In the Renaissance, for example, it was common to avoid cadences in order to keep the music going; you'd set up a cadence but have some element missing so that the music doesn't actually reach any sort of conclusion there and instead just keeps going.  A short, simple song — that is, a piece of music in a form that would earn it the label of "song", not just any piece of music — may have multiple cadences, like Oh Susanna above, while a symphonic movement in sonata form might not have any for a long time, except for a couple of key points in the piece.</p>
<p class="text">Cadences are often very formulaic and stylized — there are some specific motions that cadences generally end up having, depending on the musical language.  The musical language we're going to talk about right now is the language of <em>nusach</em>, which refers to the melodic modes and formulas used in chanting Jewish liturgy in the Ashkenazic tradition.  (We'll get to other musical languages later.)  We're going to look at four different nusachim — plural of "nusach" — on the same text to see how the nusach works; the text is a prayer from the Amidah, the Standing Prayer, which observant Jews recite three times a day and four on Shabbat and festivals.  The content of the Amidah changes depending on the occasion, but this prayer, third from the end, is short and simple and doesn't change much.  Here's the text, transliterated into the Latin alphabet:</p>

<p class="poetry"><em>R'tzeh Adonai Eloheinu b'am'cha Yisrael uvitfilatam,<br />v'hashev et haavodah lidvir beitecha.<br />V'ishei Yisrael utfilatam b'ahavah t'kabel b'ratzon,<br />uthi l'ratzon tamid avodat Yisrael amecha.<br /></em></p>
<p class="poetry"><em>V'techezeinah eineinu b'shuv'cha L'tziyon b'rachamim.<br />Baruch atah Adonai,<br />hamachazir sh'chinato L'tziyon.  (Amen.)</em></p>
<p class="poetry"><em>(Modim anachnu lach...)</em></p>

<h4 class="question">What does that mean?</h4>
<p class="text">Have favor, LORD our God, on your people Israel and their prayers, and return the service to your Temple.  And regarding the burnt sacrifices of Israel and their prayers, with love receive them in favor, and may you have favor always for the service of Israel your people.  And may our eyes behold your return to Zion in mercy.  Blessed are you LORD, who returns his presence to Zion.  (Amen.)  (We give thanks...)</p>
<p class="text">You don't have to agree with it.  Many Jews don't; this is actually a contentious issue in the liberal movements, with some movements removing all mention of the Temple sacrifices from the liturgy.  The above is the traditional text, though, recited solo by the cantor.  As for the last bit after the amen, that's actually the beginning of the <em>next</em> blessing, which often gets said as a response here.  The correct response for any blessing is "amen", but for a variety of reasons that I <em>really</em> don't need to go into, people say "Modim anachnu lach" at this point.</p>
<p class="text">This text is recited at many times, and different times call for different nusachim, different melodies.  We'll look at the nusach for weekdays, Shabbat morning, festivals, and High Holidays; there are other occasions, with their own nusach, like Shabbat afternoon, and there are various types of weekday nusach, but these four will be enough.  Also, different cantors do the nusach differently, so this is just one version, but it's fairly comparable to anyone else's correct nusach.  Ready?</p>

<? createExample('R\'tzeh Weekday'); ?>

<p class="text">Ashkenazic nusach is generally motivic (these days; it was more free-form in the past), so I labeled the motifs.  The cadences are marked with a *.  The weekday Amidah nusach in particular is major pentatonic except at cadences, and you'll notice that the cadences — the resting points — are on 5 and 3.  This nusach is actually very simple and repetitive, with these kind of alternating cadences on the 5 and the 3 and no particular rhyme or reason as to which function they should each serve, except that the cadence to the 5 seems to want the cadence to the 3 as an answer.  There are a few variations that can be thrown in, such as the motif at measure 6 that starts at the higher 3, which also breaks the alternation between the cadences.  At 10, we have the words "Baruch atah Adonai", which are the basic formula for all of the blessings in the liturgy; for most longer blessings, there's a paragraph (or several) of text, then "Baruch atah Adonai", and a (usually) short description of the thing God is or is doing that merits the particular blessing.  Consequently, there's a pretty solid break in the flow when this formula comes up, and the nusach has a special motif for this invocation and the phrase that comes afterward.  Well, it would, except that this is the boring weekday nusach, so it doesn't.  I decided to do a little elaboration myself at measure 11 by putting a melisma on "sh'chinato", but otherwise, the Blessing Formula motif is the same as the Line Start Beginning motif and the Blessing Ending is the same as the Line Start Ending motif.</p>
<h4 class="question">Wait, the concluding motifs of the nusach are the same as the ones to start a new line?</h4>
<p class="text">Yeah.  Weekday Amidah nusach is boring this way.  And just like the cadence to the 5 kind of wants a cadence to the 3 as an answer, the "amen" congregational response to a blessing formula chanted this way is nothing but the cadence to the 3, the Line Continuation motif.  Here, the congregation goes right into "Modim anachnu lach", which gets this motif, but generally it's just "amen".  Sometimes, though, the "amen" just echoes the cadence itself, as we'll see, and the cadence to the 5 isn't <em>really</em> any less final than the cadence to the 3.  The chanting could well end on either of them without much of a problem!</p>
<h4 class="question">I don't really understand why you called it a "Line Start Beginning", "Line Start Ending", etc.  These are confusing names.  Why isn't there a cadence between each of them?</h4>
<p class="text">The reason for the names will be a little clearer once we do the other nusachim, since their functions are much more obvious.  Basically, there's a phrase whose function is to serve as the start of a new line of chanting, another phrase that serves as the continuation, another to set up a conclusion, another to conclude, etc.  This simple weekday nusach doesn't distinguish between these functions very much, but we'll see what happens in the others in a bit.</p>
<h4 class="question">Phrase?  What makes it a phrase or not a phrase?</h4>
<p class="text">Why, the cadence, of course!  The reason why there isn't a cadence between the Line Start Beginning and Line Start Ending motifs is because they're one phrase.  A <em>phrase</em> ends in a cadence.</p>
<h4 class="question">Ah, that clears it up.  NOT!  This definition is circular!</h4>
<p class="text">Remember what a cadence is: it's a point where the music unambiguously arrives and finishes a statement of some sort.  That statement could be a question that merits a response, which would make it some sort of half-cadence.  A <em>phrase</em>, then, is a stretch of music that is making one contiguous statement that finishes.  In the sheet music above, I put bar lines where there's a separation between motifs, and you can see that the music doesn't really stop or rest between two motifs in the same phrase, except for maybe a momentary breath or, well, not even that, just an <em>ictus</em> — a downbeat-type accent — or an <em>agogic accent</em> — an accent made by making the note a little longer, like the eighth note at the start of measure 2 in a sea of 16th notes.  In statement terms, that's barely even the comma in this very sentence.  Since we actually have a text here, we can see how the cadences line up with it; though you may not be familiar with Hebrew, it's pretty simple to follow anyway.  Each of these phrases is actually a complete grammatical clause, with verb, subject, and object (usually in that order — welcome to Hebrew).  The first phrase, for example, goes "Favor, LORD our God, your people Israel and their prayers."  Complete sentence.  Second phrase: "And return the service to your Temple."  Complete sentence, though the sentence, like the preceding, is an imperative, so the subject is understood to be "LORD our God" and not repeated here.  And so on.  The cadences line up with the sentences because I know what I'm doing with the nusach; this is an important part of being a cantor (which I'm not, but still).</p>
<p class="text">Now, the cadences themselves actually follow a very simple formula: they're approached by step from above, and that approach note is used as an appoggiatura that resolves to the final of the cadence.  Thus, the cadence in measure 2 goes 6-5 and the cadence in measure 3 goes 4-3.  This is very common in music in general for <em>internal cadences</em> — that is, cadences that aren't at the end of a piece.  A <em>final cadence</em> — a cadence at the end of a piece — will usually end strong, with the final note on the downbeat, but internal cadences can't give too much finality to the music or it will stop things prematurely, so they often resolve on weak beats.  Ashkenazic liturgical music doesn't generally resolve anything on the strong beat, though.</p>
<p class="text">Harmonically, I don't think there's much going on here.  When the music is hovering around the low 3, the implied harmony is the tonic; when it's alternating between the 6 and 1, the subdominant is implied.  There's no dominant implied here, except <em>maybe</em> on the 4 in the cadences on 3 (which is the only time the music deviates from major pentatonic).  There's a very weak argument to be made that the 6-5 cadences are IV - I and the 4-3 cadences are V - I, but I don't buy it.  Still, the music is definitively arriving on I at the cadence, even if it kind of never left.</p>
<p class="text">The next example is the nusach from Shabbat morning:</p>

<? createExample('R\'tzeh Shabbat'); ?>

<p class="text">We're now in a different mode, which in Ashkenazic liturgical music (and klezmer) we call Ahavah Rabbah, also known as our old friend phrygian dominant.  This nusach is much clearer in terms of function of different phrases, which is much more representative of nusach in general than the repetitive nusach for weekdays.  This particular nusach begins with a phrase that jumps from 1 to 5 (see measure 2), then that phrase is followed by another, very similar phrase that jumps up to the octave before going back to the 5 in a very similar way (measure 4).  These introductory phrases are followed by a continuation phrase (line 5), then an ending phrase (measure 7).  This is the basic structure of the Shabbat morning nusach, with variations depending on the shape of the text: the continuation phrase may be omitted, or there might be other phrases and motifs added, etc.  Generally, though, each block of text begins with the Line Start First Phrase motif (and is usually followed by the Second Phrase) and ends with the Line End motif, or relatively small variations thereof.  Sometimes a cantor may use something a bit farther from the formula to vary things up, much like the high phrase in the weekday example; there are a few standard ways to do that.  In this particular blessing, "V'techezeinah eineinu" is sometimes sung with a melody like 1-3-1-3-5-4, briefly going to the iv before "b'shuv'cha L'tziyon b'rachamim" returns to the 3.  I didn't do that.  Maybe I should have.  Doesn't really matter.</p>
<h4 class="question">What about the Paragraph Introduction?</h4>
<p class="text">Ah, yeah.  That one's really uncommon these days.  I think that since service leaders are more and more often lay members of the congregation and not professional cantors, this motif has sort of fallen out of favor.  But I'm bringing it back in this example!  It highlights one of the features of the Ahavah Rabbah mode that often gets ignored, the raised 6 below the tonic (which is really just a leading tone to the b7).  Think of the motif itself as just a little extra variation.</p>
<p class="text">Now that we have more meaningfully different phrases, we can better see when the cadences happen and why.  The standard internal cadence in the Shabbat morning nusach is the 4-3 cadence we see at measures 4 and 6, which feels more like a comma than anything else.  The slightly different cadences at 3 and 10 are actually variations on a <em>different</em> cadence, going 5-3 in the same manner as the 4-3, but they're made weaker here by the metrical position and the passing tone.  And, of course, the ending phrase cadences (measures 8, 13, and 14) are to 1, in this case, b2-1.</p>
<p class="text">After a while of this pattern of Line Start First Phrase, Line Start Second Phrase, blah blah blah, Line End, we finally get to the Blessing Formula.  This one's actually really different, since the blessing formula at the end is the most important part of the blessing, and it's designed to elicit a response from the congregation.  At the motif at 11, the harmony goes to bvii for the first time, on a cadence.  This is a cadence that requires a response, and that response is the Blessing End phrase.  The cadence to the b7 functions as a half-cadence, a cadence that asks a question, and the Blessing End phrase functions as the answer to that question.  This blessing is the shortest one in the Shabbat morning Amidah, so it's not so dramatic here, but for the previous blessing, which has four relatively meaty paragraphs, lots of places for melodies, etc., the Blessing Formula is quite effective at announcing to the congregation that we're at the part where they say something.  There's a response for "Baruch atah Adonai" itself, which is "baruch hu uvaruch sh'mo", and congregants who are on top of their game will insert it between the phrases.  This response used to be sung by synagogue choirs in four-part harmony, but nowadays it's mostly just mumbled (depending on where you are in the world, anyway).</p>
<p class="text">On to the nusach for festivals:</p>

<? createExample('R\'tzeh Festival'); ?>

<h4 class="question">Uh, what key is this?  Is this A dorian?  Or A mixolydian, I guess, but... key signature?</h4>
<p class="text">Hoo boy.  Festival nusach is interesting.  To be clear, I do not know how these motifs evolved, but here they are: the final cadence in this prayer mode is to the <em>4</em> below: 1-5-4, as you can see unadorned in measure 8.  In this particular rendition, the musical mode is a plagal E minor, or possibly dorian depending on how you view the C#, and that's where the music stays except at cadences.  It's very odd but also very characteristic.  You can immediately recognize the nusach from that cadence!  I think that's part of the point, but, again, I don't know how these melodies evolved to where they are now.  I know from <a href="https://sammlungen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/freimann/content/titleinfo/853537">Abraham Baer</a> (you can read the whole book in PDF from the Goethe Universitat in Frankfurt am Main) that they were in place as of the 1870's and possibly much earlier, but how much, I couldn't tell you.</p>
<p class="text">The general structure of this nusach, for most of the text that uses it, is the Line Start phrase, some variation of the Line Start Second Phrase as an answer, then as many Line Continuation phrases as necessary, and finally, to end the sentence or paragraph, the Line End phrase, with the famous 1-5-4 cadence.  There are some variations possible, like a phrase similar to the Blessing Formula thrown in there; it could be followed by a Line Start phrase or Line End phrase or anything, really.  There's also the Paragraph Introduction motif, which I personally like but not everyone uses; while the cadence goes 1-5-4, this motif echoes it with a clear raised 6th.  There are some other motifs that are less well-known and are often used for more momentous parts of the text, which this blessing is very much not.  At the end of a blessing, of course, we have the Blessing Formula and its response; for a big ending, you go up to the 5, down to the 1, and then do the low 1-5-4 (which here is embellished a bit).  It's common to use a #4 in the upper part of the scale when it would sound good to do so; I did it at measure 3, but I could have also done it at measure 11.</p>
<p class="text">Oh, and for the record, I recorded the nusach first and <em>then</em> transcribed it into sheet music.  In case you're trying to read the music and find the rhythms too complicated to get right, well... they're just a transcription of how I chanted them, and they're very much not meant to be exact.  Nusach is an inherently improvisatory activity; you get the basic patterns and motifs in your head, and off you go, reading the text and fitting the motifs to the clauses and sentences (liturgical Hebrew doesn't generally feature much punctuation, so the commas and periods in this text were generally inserted by the editor of the prayerbook I had in front of me).  Feeling the beat in measures 2 and 3, for example, with the groups of 5 16th notes, is pointless.  I didn't do that.  I just read the text.  The name for music that follows the natural rhythm of the text is <em>logogenic</em>, as opposed to music where the melody comes first, which is <em>melogenic</em>.  Jewish liturgy has a lot of text, so it has a lot of logogenic chanting.</p>
<p class="text">The cadences are hopefully starting to make more sense by now.  In measure 1, we <em>don't</em> have a cadence.  Why?  Because the text does not call for one.  There's no pause after the Paragraph Introduction motif here.  There is at bar 2, where we have a b3-1 cadence.  The Second Phrase motif does have another not-a-cadence into the #4, but we see that, again, neither the textual nor musical thought is completed until the cadence at measure 4, which is again b3-1.</p>
<h4 class="question">How is it b3-1?  It just ends on the E, from a scale.</h4>
<p class="text">The cadence here goes G A G F# E, right?  You can kinda tell because it's all on the accented syllable of the last word, "beiTEcha".  The important note in that little run is the first G; the A, G, and F# are just decoration.  Also, you'll notice that, again, pretty much all of the cadences end on a weak beat.  That's just the style for Ashkenazic nusach.  The English language, with so many monosyllabic and <em>oxytonic</em> (stress on the last syllable) words, is suited for cadences that end on the strong beat ("I've been working on the railroad all the live-long DAY.  I've been working on the railroad just to pass the time aWAY."  Etc.).  Both languages have plenty of music and poetry with cadences on both strong and weak beats, though, so this isn't a general rule of any sort.</p>
<p class="text">At 6 we have a half-cadence, b3-2.  In a long text in this nusach, this motif is the one that repeats as long as necessary.  Note the prolongations at measure 5, alternating between the E and G, basically just to fit all the words into this phrase.  That's very common in nusach as well.</p>
<p class="text">I didn't identify a cadence at the Blessing Formula, measure 10.  Why not?  Because I don't think that the motif used here corresponds to an independent musical thought.  You're welcome to disagree!  This is in contrast with the Shabbat morning nusach above, where I believe that the Blessing Formula <em>does</em> make an independent musical thought.  The difference, for me, is that th rhythm I used in the Shabbat morning example clearly separates "Baruch" from "atah Adonai", thus giving it the two-part structure of a phrase.  I could have done it here, too; I just didn't.</p>
<p class="text">Now, I want to talk a bit about the last bar, which I've labeled "Intro or Echo?" with a question mark cadence.  It's a repetition of the previous cadence at measure 12, right?  But it can also be the beginning of the next paragraph as an introduction rather than as a cadence.  It depends on how that linking happens.  If the cantor says "Modim anachnu lach" then launches right into the rest of the following blessing, I would say that it's not a cadence, but if the cantor and congregation say it together then read in an undertone for a few moments (the cantor and congregation actually read different texts there, so sometimes they'll all read silently), it's better thought of as a cadence.  By the way, the cadence is really 1-5-4, so even though it goes 1-5-6-5-4, the 6 and 5 are only an embellishment.  That 6 is <em>harmonically</em> important (and also so, so optional) because it establishes the color of the mode; without it, the mode is different... which is also OK.  But it does not serve to execute the cadence itself.</p>
<p class="text">Finally, we have the blessing read in the nusach of the High Holidays (Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur):</p>

<? createExample('R\'tzeh High Holiday'); ?>

<p class="text">High Holiday nusach is a fairly broad nusach, with many different components that can fit together.  The basic skeleton, though, is what you see here, in plain old minor: a Line Start with a cadence on the b3, an optional Second Phrase that goes high but returns to the b3, some Continuation phrases that end on the 2, and a Line End that goes from the 5 at the start down to the 1 at the cadence.  Repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat.  For hours.  It's fun!  To be fair, the hours and hours are not <em>all</em> in this mode.  But yeah, it gets predictable very quickly.  Notably, because <em>so</em> much stuff gets added to the prayers on the High Holidays, the ends of blessings are rare and momentous events, making the Blessing Formula fairly elaborate and quite dramatic.  The effect is a little silly in this 30-odd-second blessing, but keep in mind that the preceding two blessings could easily take upwards of half an hour each (they're <em>action-packed</em>, with lots of singing, but they're still very long).  When the cantor <em>finally</em> gets to the "Baruch atah Adonai" of a section of the service that takes that long, the listener expects some major catharsis!  That's what the Blessing End motif does, with its descending minor triad: 5-b3-1.  Something I actually hadn't noticed until just now is the Blessing Formula motif, which is very similar to the Line Start phrase.  Do you see it?  It starts on the 4 just like the Line Start (ignoring the pickup on the 1), then it goes up to the 5 before going down to the b7; from the b7 it goes to a 5-b3 cadence.  They're the same, except the Blessing Formula has more noodling around.  And yet, I would not want to begin a paragraph with the Blessing Formula motif.  It's too big!</p>
<p class="text">There's a lot going on harmonically in this excerpt, in contrast to the relatively static harmony we saw in the other examples.  Measures 1-2, we have iv - i - bIII implied; measure 3 implies i (or bIII) - V/bIII - bIII; measures 4-5 have i - V; measures 6-7 have V - i.  Then it kinda repeats, with the Blessing End entirely as a i.  Out of the nusachim we've seen, this one is the most harmonically functional other than the ending.  Of course, that's not a good thing or a bad thing.  Describing a harmony as "functional" is just a useful categorization; it does not imply quality or lack thereof.</p>
<p class="text">When it comes to the cadences, they play on the traditional notions of stability to propel the music forward or provide a satisfying conclusion.  The Line Start cadence, 5-b3, is clearly stable since it's in the tonic chord, though it implies the bIII instead.  But this stability is only initial; that is, the music hasn't moved yet.  The next one is again on b3, and here, I've chosen to employ a prominent feature of the S'lichot mode (S'lichot is one of the sections of the High Holiday service, and much of the High Holiday liturgy uses S'lichot-related nusach), the b7-4-b3 cadence.  Not everyone uses it here, but it's iconic enough that I didn't want to leave it out.  Notice that the first phrase cadences on a strong beat, while the second phrase has a weak beat 4-b3, like we've seen in the other nusachim.  The next cadence is also a weak beat cadence, this time a half-cadence b3-2, but it's been shifted by half a beat so it appears to be a strong beat cadence.  It's not.  Don't be fooled!  The strong beat is the downbeat of measure 5.  This Line Continuation motif, by the way, is quite similar to the one I used in the festival nusach above.  I could have used a different continuation motif, like one that goes up to the octave or comes up from the 5 below; there's actually a lot of variety here.  This is just the one that came out when I recorded this time.  If I were to chant it again, there would probably be quite a few differences.  In fact, I encourage you to look at the various versions of this very blessing available on <a href="https://offtonic.com/nusach/index.html?nid=58&sidpath=,2212,2260&sid=2373&o=1">NusachDB</a> and see how they vary (check the High Holiday Amidah Nusach 1 variants).  I split up the two paragraphs.  While you're here, you can also check out the <a href="https://offtonic.com/nusach/index.html?nid=4&sidpath=,5467,5469&sid=5513&o=1">weekday version</a> (look for Weekday Amidah Nusach 1 variants), the <a href="https://offtonic.com/nusach/index.html?nid=16&sidpath=,3917,3921&sid=4059&o=1">Shabbat version</a> (Shabbat Shacharit Nusach 1), and the <a href="https://offtonic.com/nusach/index.html?nid=34&sidpath=,766,768&sid=839&o=1">festival version</a> (Festival Amidah Nusach 1).  (Note that on some special occasions, another paragraph is inserted in between the two in the examples, and on holidays, the second paragraph is sometimes replaced with a different one.)</p>
<p class="text">Measure 6 could proceed in many different ways, depending on the length of the text; I didn't call it a cadence here, but the b6-5 that occurs is at the very least cadence-like.  A common variant is to end that run on the 2, the D# here, and just not go on to the C#-A-G#.  That's even less cadential.  We're still setting up the Line End ending with a fairly clear V chord, and that pays off in another weak beat cadence, the 2-1 at measure 7.  This one also uses an iconic motif, the 2-7-1-2-1.  It's funny; when I hear that motif, I want to sit down, because after standing up for a pretty long stretch of service, when this motif finally shows up is when we can sit.  I was once at a High Holiday service where the leader used this motif at an inappropriate time, and everyone sat down despite it not being time to do so yet.  Power of musical association, I suppose!</p>
<p class="text">There's not much more to say about the Blessing Formula cadence, except that, even though it's at least in appearance a moderately strong beat cadence to a stable tone (5-b3), it very, very much wants an answer.  And that answer is thundering: the 5-b3-1 cadence at 13 (echoed at 14, where there's no ambiguity about function, unlike in the festival example).  An interesting observation about this Blessing End segment: this entire nusach has been in an authentic minor mode, but the ending shifts registers <em>down</em> and becomes plagal.  I wonder if cantors used to sing it up high, but it was too high for them so they brought it down an octave.  Sounds like a fun and doable research question, so I'll leave it as an exercise for the reader.</p>
<h4 class="question">Gee. <em>Thanks</em>.</h4>
<p class="text">You're welcome.  I know you were being sarcastic, but you can actually see what the nusach used to be like in the 1870's in Germany.  Abraham Baer (mentioned above) wrote a compendium of synagogue music called <a href="https://sammlungen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/freimann/content/titleinfo/853537">Baal T'fillah</a> (which means a master of prayer, or a service leader) that you can download for free.  The labels are in Hebrew and the text is in German, so if you want to check out the nusachim in these examples, I'll tell you where to look.  The weekday nusach is in numbers 75 for the first paragraph, 77 for the second, and back to 52 for the Blessing Formula.  Baer's nusach is quite different from the popular weekday Amidah nusach these days, being in a kind of hybrid between F# minor and A major and not very pentatonic at all.  But, if you look at the first paragraph, you'll find cadences going F#-C#-E, F#-E, A-E-F#, and ending on E-D-C#.  If we interpret these as A major, we find the low 6-5 and low 4-3 cadences from the weekday nusach I used.  To me, this tells me that the melodies are actually related.  The low 4-3 cadence at the end is especially iconic and unlikely to be the same by coincidence.  (Do notice that the phrasing of the text is different between Baer and my prayerbook, going "v'hashev et haavodah lidvir beitecha v'ishei Yisrael; utfilatam b'ahavah..." instead of putting the phrase ending after "beitecha".</p>
<p class="text">The Shabbat morning nusach can be found at number 563 for the first paragraph, 565 for the second (in two versions, but the first is the one that corresponds to ours), 557 for the Blessing Formula, and 566 for the response.  This nusach is very different from the one I used as well, though it's at least still in the same phrygian dominant mode.  The cadences don't resemble the ones I used at all: low b7-1, 3-4-5, 4-3, b2-b7-1, and b6-5-4.  The Blessing Formula does at least cadence down to the b7, but the 3-b7-1 ending is not related.  The beginning of "Hael hakadosh" in 558 is at least closer, but I don't really see a connection here.</p>
<p class="text">The festival nusach is in numbers 797, 798, and 790 for the Formula.  This one is a lot closer to the festival nusach I used.  The key is A minor, so the first cadence, using an extended tonic recitation tone, is 1-5-4, with a nice little raised 6th as an embellishment.  The next phrase asks a question to 1-b3 then answers it with b3-1; I'm not sure you'd count the question as a cadence here.  The motif resembles the Second Phrase motif I used.  This is followed by a clear variant of the Line Continuation motif, with a modified 4-b3-2 cadence, and it leads to an embellished Line End motif with a 1-5-4.  The ending motif I used goes up to the 5 then down to the 1, while this one goes down to the low 4 (in a 2-1-7-b6-5-4 scale, note the lowered b6 and raised 7) before the 1-5-4 cadence.  In both cases, it's still a downward scale, so I wouldn't say that the motifs are very different.  "V'techezeinah" has a clear Line Continuation motif as well, which wasn't my choice but is perfectly reasonable to do there, and the Blessing Formula is identical to the one I used.  There's a difference in the ending, which <em>doesn't</em> have the iconic 1-5-4 cadence... but look at the congregational response, which puts it in the "Modim anachnu lach" <em>with</em> the raised 6th.  The cantor's ending is actually cognate with the Blessing End Beginning that I used!</p>
<p class="text">Finally, the High Holiday nusach is at 1124 and 1125.  The response to the Formula is all the way back to 1073, but it's not very interesting.  This is what I was talking about when I said the two preceding blessings took forever.  The nusach here is also completely different from the one I used, except that it's in minor.  It's kind of boring, honestly.  At "V'techezeinah", though, there's actually a little rhythmic melody, probably for variety.  Kinda cool, I think.  Unlike the rest of the nusach, the Blessing Formula is practically identical to the one I used, except that Baer doesn't really do the whole 5-b3-1 ending thing (you can look through the other blessings if you want to see it).  It's <em>there</em>, more in the "amen" than anywhere else (well, "Modim anachnu lach" in this case), but Baer doesn't make a big deal of it and chooses to be more creative than formulaic with his endings.  What this tells me is that the 5-b3-1 <em>is</em> traditional, and Baer was aware of this tradition but didn't want to overdo it.  I think that the 5-b3-1 has become such an iconic part of the High Holiday service these days that it shouldn't be skipped, but in Baer's time it wasn't as iconic.  I have guesses about the rest of the High Holiday Amidah nusach: it's in minor and it's simply improvised, without clear motivic guidance, except for the formula at the end, and a more defined form evolved only in the second half of the 20th century, given the sources I've seen with this material.  It's just a guess, though.</p>
<p class="text">If you're at all interested in Jewish liturgy, leafing and singing through Baer's monumental work is a great and largely unique experience.  I should make it clear, however, that the Ashkenazic tradition has never been monolithic, and the nusach of today is not necessarily <em>descended</em> from Baer's.  Baer was well-versed in the German and Polish traditions, but the Lithuanian and Eastern European traditions have been arguably more influential in today's general Ashkenazic liturgical music.  Central Europe has tended to deemphasize modes with an augmented second, like phrygian dominant and Ukrainian-dorian (dorian #4), which are more in line with the musical culture in Eastern Europe.  The Chasidic tradition has also been very influential in the last century, but it was still relatively new in Baer's time.  Despite all that, we can still see the commonalities by looking at the cadences.  The cadence is like a signature for these motifs; it's what orients the listener within the mode.</p>
<p class="text">Now that we understand the role of cadences in melody, let's switch gears and discuss what we're <em>really</em> here for: harmonic cadences.  For this, we're going to have to take the historical approach, because cadences are relatively ritualized within the Western tradition.  I keep talking about formulas, and cadences have traditionally been formulaic, which helps the listener recognize them across pieces.  If we're going to understand cadences as they're used in Common Practice, we'll need to understand where these formulas came from!</p>
